mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal change that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast try to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what come into question is their opinion on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough question and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sale pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesman film from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross a this film try to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that get these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him what make this film different than the others is it blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do a both must sell their product and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life ha sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of good they sold themselves that made them be salesman larry and phil have one way of doing thing and have no qualm of incorporating a sale pitch a part of their life bob think he is above the fray and he pitch every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his action the word of jesus he literally belief in bob is a baptist who take a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he read the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can t even say because he love her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personality is stark larry is all business he simply want to close the sale he come into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot stick rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tell him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best year have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now find himself suffering from some troubling dream and questioning what he belief in he ha always been a charmer shaking everyone s hand trying to please his client while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive a a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenty and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesman throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throw a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act a the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but wa wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tell the boy about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sale pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product a they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesman are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their as the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room a they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their life these three performer were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that it more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see

treasure in o brother where art thou right for the beginning of o brother the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmate breaking rock along the road in unison to a work song the camera flow around the hard toiling men giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that end with our three hero ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john turturro escaping across a cotton field it is the beginning of a journey that take on different meaning and urgency to each member of the trio a strong suite a always with the coen brother is the depth of character of the folk they create in their film their character are goofy and comical like nicolas cage in raising arizona or dramatic a albert finney and john turturro in miller s crossing and even a mix of the two with france mcdormand in fargo in all case and in o brother too the character populating their film are three dimensional people ulysses everett is a handsome hair obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brain department but he seems like a genius when compared to the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of million their odyssey take on the mystical proportion of homer s original material a they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous siren who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoal and a cyclops who beat them and take all their money there is magic too when delmar belief that pete wa turned into a horny toad by the siren the story meander through the different vignette of the boy adventure giving the flick a choppy episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow some of the interlude are an epiphany though the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar playing tommy johnson chris thomas king and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere run by it blind owner stephen root they become the soggy bottom boy for the sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded a they sing the traditional tune i am a man of constant sorrow it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and give u in my mind the best movie song of the year contrasting this and other wonderful moment the sexy seduction by the siren come to mind are some pretentious bit that detract from the overall quality of o brother in particular near the end is a scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched the scene is overblown and flashy and reek of the wizard of oz they don t say lion and tiger and bear oh my and there s no dorothy but it is the land of oz we re seeing here the high and low of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several level george clooney is funny charming a little dumb and one of the handsomest actor in the business today he ha the charm of a s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situation with dignity ulysses ha an ongoing obsession with his hair risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnet his vanity will come to plague him a it would any mystical hero wanderer while clooney is the

church congregation in their mass baptism delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that make him shine the taciturn pete a played by longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and give them the necessary angst all together the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooge and the three musketeer a they

one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of a year old english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girl the year old lucy carrie and the year old bea bella ha arrived for a year s stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughter might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she say she is a she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who ha all the answer she ha not planned thing out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn t seem like it s much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drug a world wide youthful phenomenon during this period where many westerner came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authority even though drug are illegal there but this is not shown a one of her reason for being here in this film the subject of drug is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way a the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitar and bragging about the hit of acid they have taken even the one coming here for spiritual reason to follow the mystical sufi seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experience of sigmund freud s grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the director s brother who ha previously directed regeneration the playboy and trojan eddie the title of the film come from the squealing giggle that saying hideous kinky give the little girl with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meet an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband a a father figure for the girl the girl readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girl really don t know what to make of the relationship it especially bother bea who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and want to go home thing go surprisingly sour when bilal take them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness a he ha a wife who still life there this scene didn t make too much sense a to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man wa totally uneducated in the custom of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next a they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kill them when he fall asleep by the wheel lucy take it all in stride and ha a good disposition for travel while bea just want to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet a the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and it bustling street scene expansive view illustrious mosque and grand sunset kate enacts the feel of what it wa like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experience while awaiting to gather her sensibility again and wa fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experience a many a drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from group like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope wa that the two innocent girl would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the family s travel which is on the edge ha julia waking up screaming from dream that are bleakly haunting but when she get up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thought it will dawn on her when bea take ill a she reflects on what the sufi guru tell her whom she finally meet and is driven to tear in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tear are memory a gift from god the film s weakness wa the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in it risk free tenor she wa there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experience many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that ha a lot to offer it follower contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pas her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kid along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film s strength is in how all the character are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcoming bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girl are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who care about the child but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she wa trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she ha another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmare about where she s at this is a very freudian way to look at thing a this sudden realization that thing are not right put an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who s to say if the child are also not better off for surviving their experience just like she probably wa

Sentence: seen april at p m at crossgates cinema guilderland n y theater by myself for free using my hoyts critic s pas theater rating very good seat sound and picture do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story everyone ha their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several character chance encounter all effect each other in extreme way in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of character that wouldn t usually be the type to have an entire film revolve around them such a a teenage supermarket cashier a bottom of the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actor these type of character might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a mid level drug dealer a narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guest a zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round thing out how they will all come together is the process the film deal with i d imagine the concept to the film started out a the creator testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film start out a anything else with little indication of what s to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent she s not very charming especially to her customer but this is played mostly for laugh rather than characterization and it work maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character but she s far from masculine a creative character indeed thing start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hour of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vice for the sake of the experience this agreement start a three pronged storyline a it allows simon to go to la vega for the weekend with his friend and in turn drag ronna and her friend into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other character zack mohr and adam wolf who we don t think much of when they first appear a supporting character but later will become major player to the film s makeup another process used by the filmmaker to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begin to show it mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movie today and so the film begin to take shape first by following ronna and her friend on a one night adventure that begin with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn t exactly go a planned but that s what keep it all so interesting the second storyline start at the same moment a ronna s story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friend head to vega for a night on the town and in the process experience thing they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlap with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle we re shown thing we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the event that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were i d really like to dissect each of the three storyline and especially how the film wrap up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is it constant surprise and unpredictability and not due to plot twist or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film doe so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such a liman it s a great accomplishment he doesn t just depict a story he wrap u up in it all pulling u into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general it s clear the script ha been inspired by many source with both obvious and subtle reference yet it never scream rip off tone mood where other hollywood film have failed to bring the charm of the independent to the mainstream this one is able to create it own sense of the macabre it s not overly dark or twisted and the comedy isn t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we re able to get a sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situation even when their action are surprising it never seems very out of synch performance every actor nail their role see above theme theory the film doesn t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social message instead it s more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure see also the big lebowski clerk jackie brown pulp fiction true romance also by liman swinger

Sentence: showgirl is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven director and joe eszterhas writer their last effort basic instinct played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone s taste but certainly a well crafted movie possibly that movie s greatest strength wa that the most important event happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the character future so there wa no need to film it there wa actually about four hour worth of screen story there but eszterhas found way to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what wa really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trail the major element that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirl we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent character we have show for the eye and the ear plotlines that play on several level we have beautifully delineated character who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who s trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slip into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who s not known for treating his character well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movie but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quarter century ha pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limit to movie making his most recent three movie robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drive and now he s exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several part of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewer have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which us naked lady a scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked lady it s about people in an environment where naked lady are common and why such an environment should exist it s about the scum who use other people a power trip toy and the need to escape their power it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human value don t pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scene is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn t sexually exciting say a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex ha been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actor you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few gun going off and a few people getting killed and you don t make a movie about la vega showgirl without showing a few la vega showgirl and in an awful lot of vega show an awful lot of lady wear very little clothing this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity showgirl de glamorizes the la vega show and sex industry with great effectiveness nomi is played in a very good performance by elizabeth berkley who give u a solid picture of a woman with limited talent who s at the end of her rope desperate to live a life better than the one she s known she ha nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker trying to be something better than she seems destined to be when nomi realizes she s gone too far for too little she catch herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she want to be gina rivera play molly a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi providing her with what may be the one solid positive relationship in nomi s entire life molly is the one who make the difference and provides the role model and framework nomi need to verify the value system she ll be using for the rest of her life and nomi s feeling for molly are the spur that force nomi s decision gina gershon play cristal an aging but still very attractive starring dancer a reflexively competitive manipulator who s become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crook and scum around her gershon play cristal a a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch a fading talent made bitter by self awareness her character is very well drawn and performed in a major scene in a hospital room she acknowledges what she is and in essence pass the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi need to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important part in this movie are woman of different stripe molly is an honest hard working person who mean well and nearly dy because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideal and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the specie of stardom that can be had in la vega nomi belief she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn t need la vega or it brand of stardom the male part in this movie are simply prop they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirl exist kyle maclachlan whose single best previous work wa a an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden give u a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two leg camouflaged a a nice guy glenn plummer play a dancer who s working a a bellboy and provides a bit of alternate perspective plummer s character is the only one in the movie who s maintaining an interest in dance a a performing art but even he s succumbed to the cult of manipulation plummer s character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie some of jost vacano s cinematography is fantastic and one particular delineation of nomi s character alteration a no dialog scene using nothing but color change in the lighting is utterly terrifying this movie is rated nc due to language sexual situation full frontal nudity violence and probably the costuming a well i don t see a way this particular story could have been told well without it and i regard it a a legitimate exercise in movie making but don t go see it if you re not in a tough mood the only person it s possible to like in this movie end up in an i c u on life support and there is probably not one character in this movie you d enjoy meeting in person

Sentence: it ha been three long year since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or a million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker ha been virtually invisible surfacing briefly a a co director of the wildly uneven four room and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he ha moonlighted a an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performance now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino ha returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard s novel rum punch offer solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theater disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which start out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double cross and triple cross and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademark witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tune and close ups of womens bare foot yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dog and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous effort an approach that added tension and edginess to the narrative and there aren t nearly a many deliciously offbeat conversation this time around there s a samuel l jackson monologue about gun a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merit of hiding in a car trunk and a jackson robert niro exchange that recall some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that s about it jackie brown s lone innovation is it presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspective this isn t exactly an original technique it ha been done numerous time before most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire however while in those two movie and others there wa a legitimate plot reason for the multiple point of view tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional had the scene in question been shown from only one of the three vantage nothing would have been lost a a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon this time around instead of john travolta it s blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown ha become jackie brown in one of many nod to the most famous segment of grier s career tarantino us a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credit there are also several instance during jackie brown when the director offer a sly wink towards certain convention of the blaxploitation genre although grier never doe any butt kicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who get caught transporting drug and money into the united state she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keep her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv s banyon to post the necessary then plan to shoot jackie if she prof disloyal jackie pass ordell s test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle of ordell s money into the united state without tipping off the fed soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isn t nearly a invigorating or compelling a character a jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guy who rarely smile role bridget fonda is around for three discernible reason to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clock in at several minute over the two and a half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep u guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keep thing moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabe than something from the director himself when it come to recent caper film like the grifter and bound jackie brown is a second tier effort it s an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender

Sentence: one of the biggest cliche of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective look at a wall of picture and other police information and suddenly spot the clue which reveals who the killer is sure it s been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girl work on overused but always fun one of my personal rule about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it go around giving it story this rule applies highly to kiss the girl there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girl is certainly well made however the whole film scream of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of it actor and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actor capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choice by the filmmaker one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make wa to put the name of the killer in the opening credit that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i wa waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girl show almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him a the hero he get a call about a woman who ha shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera ha been missing for four day this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and a a result we can t sympathize with detective cross however what make kiss the girl slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these trait becomes a target for casanova what the serial killer like to call himself because of these character developing scene we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wake up and find herself in a cell somewhere in the wood remembering that the killer gave her certain rule she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova come to punish her she break out and escape by jumping over a waterfall after she is found she begin to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girl take on the form of every other serial killer film a the two lead search for the rest of the victim held captive many people will compare this film to s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarity are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what make kiss the girl so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shot were trying too hard to impress u sometimes a simple shot is the best one however many of the shot are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing make this scene work so well the chaotic and mtv type cutting give the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd s character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girl is it actor morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actor detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven because of freeman s powerful presence he carry half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of today s most promising dramatic actress in fact her performance is better than freeman s if that is even possible her character is more original than freeman s and she handle it wonderfully we finally have a female character in a movie like this who doe more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast member do a much a they can with it cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately ha scrap for a character tony goldwyn fair slightly better but we don t really get to know his character either gina ravera give a good performance but again she isn t in many of the scene so a a result of all these small supporting part the weight of the film lie on the two lead and they do a phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspect of the film are quite good director gary fleder doe a good job of controlling his actor but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scene a a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scene however to his credit he doe manage a terrific first half part of the blame fall on david klass i m sure the book developed many of the lesser character more but klass focus on the two main part while this may give the two lead more screentime many of the small character are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girl always seems intelligent none of the conversation are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problem i had with the movie wa the motive of the killer i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer s motive is because of rejection from woman or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friend is a shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girl is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibility of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girl somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performance the cinematography add a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movie which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor and ashley judd add another notch on her acting belt i must also say that i loved the ending the showdown between good and evil wa quite tense and the resolution of the scene make almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn t anyway

his action unnecessarily spell thing out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scene depicting the real world outside truman s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shot from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussion felt a the film finally shift outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and it insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti voyeuristic tirade such a that of the recent costa gavras film mad city i ve always believed that the versatile m linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she ha always seems to have a impish gleam in her eye and in the truman show she run rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin a she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogan cheerfully going over the top it s hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that she d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laugh department of a film m linney is a delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rule the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interlude which typify his traditional part but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it s difficult not to root for truman in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which make him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there s an early scene where he s down on his knee gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gag it s almost poetic how this notorious look at me actor successfully tone it down to play a character who s constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performance by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman s antiseptic white picket fenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitz s original score technical credit are first rate all around while the truman show is clearly a definitive high concept film it s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessor utilising common element abound ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner all the same this is a visionary award calibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film s concept seems unfathomably outrageous it s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world

Sentence: in chocolat a chocolate shop owner tell her customer to look into a spinning object of obscure texture pattern and line hoping she ll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they ll most enjoy some scoff the idea but everyone who gaze into the complexity of the spinning object wind up seeing something different than the next revealing personality trait which the person may not have known they had before this can easily stand a a model for chocolat a a whole on the surface it appears to be a light fluffy fable with no depth or true worth but when one take a second deeper look chocolat s true color begin to shine through making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it lasse hallstrom s chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted not to mention one of the best film of the year what give chocolat it magic much like hallstrom s winner of two academy award the cider house rule is it willingness to say what s on it mind without holding back to prevent offending audience the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewer but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film say about narrow mindedness chocolat center it story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rule and the majority life by only one law religion the bulk of the townspeople with few exception are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly non religious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confection in the chocolate shop vianne open many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud a cartoon like alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business on the other hand the shop is a delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in vianne s shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parent koening which come a a result of his mother carrie ann moss believing armande is a bad influence a she doe not hold the same strict religious belief that she doe also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offer a home and befriends juliette binoche is charming and honest a vianne genuinely capturing her character s determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy independent human being but most of chocolat s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performance of the supporting actress lena olin previously nominated for an oscar in deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of a lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs judi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching a armande voizin carrie ann moss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix show a more solid side of her acting skill not previously seen crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously victoire thivisol show much promise a anouk a young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down a trade ad for chocolat sum up best the power the actress have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary woman one extraordinary movie that s not to say the men don t do their share though alfred molina make for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh o conor add quite a bit of comic relief a the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp give a strong performance a the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and spark the romantic interest of vianne the technical aspect of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the element of each genre to be found within the film cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portman s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rule chocolat adapted by robert nelson jacob from the joanne harris novel is a wonderful little treat of a film one that will most likely win over the heart of audience and the vote of academy member this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax film assures the latter while not a powerful a the cider house rule lasse hallstrom s chocolat is a film which work on all level a a drama a comedy a fable a romance and a fairy tale and it even life up to it name it is delicious to savor the taste of easy to digest and like all excellent chocolate it is memorable for day afterward the bottom line chocolat is pure pleasure

Sentence: when i saw the trailer for this film i laughed harder than i had in quite some time while i wa therefore pretty well psyched to see it i wa ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good i m happy to say that there s something about mary is not one of those trailer let down in fact watching this film wa quite a fine way to spend two hour the film open up in flashback to at a high school in cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller is a social reject who can t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom until he come to the defense of the mentally retarded warren w earl brown who s being harassed by one of the school jock it seems warren s sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up mary take an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom ted wa just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted ha an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital fast forward to the present where ted ha cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but ha weekly therapy session in order to deal with his obsession of the past year mary whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hire slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love however when pat find mary he fall for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affection there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought u dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedy they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friend or co worker to think you had such a great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brother have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic style from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gag might be offensive to some seeming like residual from the farrelly brother last two film they almost all work i have not seen many movie in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute you ll be laughing at something ted say and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment one of the great thing this film ha going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he s a guy who just look awkward in almost every situation ted s a nice fellow and try to do his best but for some reason or another thing just don t always work out it s comical but also ha that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top actually i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighty the film wa like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a big time bowling hustler it wa parody at it finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late early like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that show s cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she date and some of the quality she look for make mary look paper thin at time however diaz pull the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she s got guy just falling over each other to be with her heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it wa annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change and you know it s really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clark s pool house anyway here s another good piece of casting a dillon slip beautifully into the role of the guy who try to worm his way into mary s heart the supporting performance are also good chris elliott ha a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who play mary s neighbor magda and also appeared a the landlady in kingpin provides some good laugh especially in scene with her benji like dog which act a the focal point for a few of the funniest moment of the film lee evans a mary s friend tucker display a flexibility in acting and accent which surprise and contributes to an interesting plot twist the farrelly brother and scriptwriter ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable time where the film drag the only problem i saw wa their use of a couple of musician who provide segue between several key scene they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera it s a device which wa amusing for about three second when they opened the film after that it got a little annoying and it s unfortunate that those spot interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gag humorous line and solid comedic acting there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater

Sentence: plot a young recruit get plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others he s got ambition he s got goal and he love everything he see about being the number one gangster violence lot of swearing and betrayal ensue critique a very good serious minded unique british gangster flick which miss the great mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and a so so ending here s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so it s not entirely new but it s definitely original when all put together a done here the thing i liked most about this movie wa it authentic portrayal of the time period in which it wa taking place it s and these dude are looking good yes it s all about the suit fella the italian shoe the cufflink the tie and the bird that s lady for those uninitiated hanging around you here are a bunch of horrible men gangster if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting head all over the place but that s not the basis of this movie the basis of this film come in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his crony paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affect the other you know how there are always these hanger on gangster type who latch on to the godfather the leader the top dog of every crime organization well most of the time these dude are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their bos so all the gangster number one need to worry about is his enemy on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayal the messed up loyalty the honor code among bad guy into play within the same group and present it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isn t trying to be guy ritchie here and doesn t over stylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he go straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scene which are still embedded in my mind a i type this the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eye in fact the last time that i ve seen a guy so scared in a movie wa john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brother miller s crossing scary shite but there s an ever better scene than that in this film this one feature bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that man s point of view but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one that s right he doe the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertone present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his bos why doe he get so upset when he fall in love with that woman but the flick s not perfect in fact i didn t mind malcolm mcdowell s voice over narration at first but a the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented a such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do wa swear and call people the c word umpteen time and even described one scene a it wa happening so i opened the door then went up the lift etc it s like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen overdone i also didn t quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that it s supposed to be taking place year later and folk still seem to be holding grudge still in love still living in the same apartment i mean c mon it s year man i don t know somehow it didn t work all that well for me but one of my favorite genre ha always been the crime movie and this one is a decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell s narration of the obvious plot point and concentrate on the film s stronger attribute such a it style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period it original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group it memorable sequence and the solid performance from it two main lead bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flick that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of film it s the real deal note this film is packed with strong accent all around which make it hard to make out some of the word from time to time it s also quite violent and i don t remember any film that used the c word a much a this one so leave the kid at home for this one where s joblo coming from american psycho a clockwork orange donnie brasco fight club get carter godfather godfather ii goodfellas lock

entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all story are about select moment of time and place in the character life but only the truly great one are able to define their reality well enough so the audience can experience it just a the character do therefore gone with the wind deserves accolade for it ability to tell the epic story it doe in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner it s a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film take place in georgia before during and after the civil war this play a major factor in the film s success to use such a historic setting present many possibility and problem since no one wa alive at the time to verify it accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factor to potential viewer can a story set so long ago be relatable now the film confronts all these problem paradoxically by not cronfronting them it doesn t simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything make sense and said concern are irrelevant building a strong foundation is important to all form of medium without which what is there to build on we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our character especially our main character scarlett o hara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she know how her society work wherein everything she doe can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequence may be being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men and their woman to ensure she get her way whether it be obvious i e who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e getting married just to spite someone the man she claim to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who doe not seem to have the same passion for her a she doe for him he isn t so arrogant and demanding a scarlett in fact he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable character one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friend but she never suspect the jealously scarlett ha for her and the love she ha for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesn t give her much emotional self defense acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story a a whole is the daper stong willed cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable he s quite a character all right everyone listens to what he ha to say even though he s got a bad reputation butler make no apology for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tell everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tell his fellow southerner there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out this anger them not for his lack of faith but because he ha the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factory do we have food do we have a navy all we have is tobacco all true statement and yet the south still insists he s wrong butler is a shifty character to be sure but he take such pride in his arrogance it s appealing scarlett notice this too when she first see him and from the look butler give her we know he s not going to stop until he ha her but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley and during a scene which set the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story go on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflict she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dy this give the film many opportunity to bring in more character into the epic story some are vital for only a few scene but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film in most film only a few character exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable a it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone ha signficance even people in the background seem more than just extra wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the film make for a real sense of time and place the filmmaker could have easily set more scene indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these type of simple approach are never taken the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last day of the civil war fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene ha scarlett working a a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no not my leg don t cut off my leg another scene show her simplying trying to cross a street but a the camera pull back we see that her path is blocked by hundred of wounded soldier but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be a the second half begin the film concentrate more on scarlett a a completely independent woman who single handedly take care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she ha can t help her when she must pay exuberhant tax set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begin their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each us the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other scarlett continues to use her manipulative power over men to get what she want and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she try to one up him such a marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposite attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett go way beyond opposing personality it border on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaf it up to u to make this call both have thing the other want and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate thing and throughout the final act of the film we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotion were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way is possible and it s a mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewing it s safe to say most of u won t live such overly dramatic life a those in gone with the wind but it s still a masterpiece for it ability to give u a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain

Sentence: every once in a while a film sneak up on me and take me completely by surprise i don t necessarily mean in term of quality rather i m referring to the mere knowledge of it existence usually i know what film are on the way a year in advance but two week ago i had never heard of princess caraboo it ha slipped rather quietly into limited release and appears destined to slip out just a quietly that s a shame because princess caraboo is a delightful fable romantic gentle and very appealing what s more it s surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp witted lesson in english social history princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early th century england involving a young woman phoebe cates who is found wandering the countryside apparently unable to speak any english she is taken in by good hearted gentlewoman mr worrall wendy hughes her banker husband jim broadbent is none too pleased about this strange houseguest until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island the princess caraboo this development inspires plan for a lucrative trading venture for mr worrall and an introduction into elite social circle for mr worrall however local journalist john gutch stephen rea is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be and set out to find out the truth about princess caraboo a a social satire and comedy of manner princess caraboo is a winner it take place in an era when it wa common practice in england to jail vagrant and hang beggar and that practice come in for an obvious hazing but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr worrall a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude he is worse than one of the idle rich he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them and since the house and money are all from mr worrall he is a bit too close to them for comfort while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule director and co writer michael austin keep the treatment too light hearted to be heavy handed he also take a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper class a the princess becomes a sensation at court in one of the film s best sequence princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john session and the lord and lady end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance it is then that princess caraboo show how easily people are swept up in sensation an idea that take on a timeless quality and make the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show social commentary aside princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment the performer are mostly delightful particularly phoebe cates who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime her supporting player are also appealing wendy hughes a the patient and kindly mr worrall kevin kline a frixos the worralls suspicious and superior greek butler stephen rea a the world weary but ultimately romantic gutch only john lithgow is a disappointment turning in a limp performance a a scholar who attempt to verify the princess s identity the story twist and turn just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt without becoming gimmicky it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn t given more time to develop because the potential seemed to be there when it finally doe blossom it seems too quick to be plausible princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing it sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewer seeking a fantasy romp still it ha both escapist and intellectual appeal and is well worth seeking out it is the kind of film that make my job it most rewarding a hidden gem

Sentence: wong kar wei s fallen angel is on a purely visceral level one of the most exciting film i ve seen in a long while unfortunately wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible character for the audience to root for ordinarily that alone would be enough to sink a movie but in the case of fallen angel this is not so every shot in this film is exciting just to look at wong doe really interesting thing with the camera but he doesn t allow the pyrotechnic to completely take over a wa the case with last year dismal off which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe ugh the movie follows three pair of lost soul a they struggle to find some meaning in their life i can t say much more than that a i didn t really know what wa going on most of the time in fact it wasn t until about halfway through the movie that i wa able to distinguish between each character the constantly moving camera doesn t really allow for the audience to associate with any one character we re always kept at a distance from these people i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the character fallen angel is a refreshing change of pace from most hollywood film which never bother to try anything different at least on a visual level in fact i d go so far a to say that fallen angel is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i ve ever seen sure there s director like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgy of death but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assault the sens with image is truly something worth celebrating but if wong wish to become a legendary filmmaker he need to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome image there were far too many instance during fallen angel in which i asked myself now who are these people again is this that first couple or the second couple it wa impossible to keep track perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which by introducing them to u with name card a in scorsese s mean street that s really besides the point though wong kar wei ha proven himself through very few film that s he s a movie maker to watch let s just hope that he hone his storytelling skill with his next few movie

Sentence: robert redford is very good at playing character who have incredible god given gift but are able to act like ordinary people in the natural he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs the baseball player who wa destined to be the best there ever wa but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he wa the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played a man who wa so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford wa still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans redford again play such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who ha the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horse wa just too good to pas up despite his enormous and rare gift when it come to training troubled horse a magazine article coin the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker see himself a an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life booker s talent are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson wa recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horse an eighteen wheeler kill grace s friend severely wound and traumatizes grace s horse pilgrim and cause grace to lose part of her right leg annie belief that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed a well which lead her to booker at first she try to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn t work instead she pack up grace and pilgrim leaf her husband robert sam neill behind and head for the rolling hill of montana where booker run a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister in law diane dianne wiest in many way the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west ha always been a great american tradition of renewal and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana a a variation on the classic theme of city v country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the character arrive in the wide open space of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begin to dissipate annie s controlling nature begin to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just a in love with the grand montana country in this film a he wa when he directed a river run through it six year ago in many way the horse whisperer come from the same poetic vein a river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minute shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountain but then that would ruin the magic much of the film s photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert natural born killer platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which take place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filter and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shift to montana richardson switch to soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a aspect ratio in term of the story itself the horse whisperer give u the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s a brief encounter and clint eastwood s adaptation of robert james waller s the bridge of county richard lagravenese co screenwriter here also adapted bridge although the horse whisperer ha a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband fall to sam neill he play the character a a decent hard working man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he love his wife more than she love him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feel about each character it show booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert look somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap a they enter the pen booker assuredly swing over the fence while robert hesitates then open the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it s a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scene in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker s horse training method are mythical and unrealistic the scene with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scene between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moment in the film there are no dramatic sex scene but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty body grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantee unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moment like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission

Sentence: in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant lead a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia robert walk in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an on again off again love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film open with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom a the title credit appear over a montage of slow motion sequence featuring the actress s appearance in film and at premiere coming out of limousine walking the red carpet and such without word this sequence give u a background to her character following however is a set up narration by william indicating what he doe and where he life i don t know why the filmmaker chose to go with a narration which tell u nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minute of film and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view a he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality win u over easily in fact much of notting hill s strength lie in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricot from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kiss william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn t say a word then add well i ll probably tell myself now and then but i d never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we re constantly exposed to william s thought feeling action and desire but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feel for him there are a couple of instance where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the time in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two make this hugh grant s film hand down he get the great scene look for one in which he ha to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great line and give an overall wonderful performance julia robert fan will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy lean a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans a spike william s eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make u laugh hugh bonneville emma chamber james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard a william s friend and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folk react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it s a scene most of u will probably think would play out in our own living room were we faced with a similar situation roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep u off our foot but doe give u more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instance in this film where large amount of time pas whereas some film are content to simply put in a caption saying eight month later michell present u with more interesting cue such a william s walk though his neighborhood while the season change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred foot in the air we re generally used to scene where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keep going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly a an enhancement to many of the film s scene and some of this might have been better toned down but in other area it work to full effect it s kind of a mixed bag but still fare better than many of today s lighthearted movie which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film ha some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill s grant and robert will not go down in history a one of the all time greatest film pairing but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspect of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hour you should expect to laugh more than cry and that s not so bad

Sentence: labelling is sometimes everything in original mad max the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future thus making it one of the science fiction classic despite the future world being almost exactly like our own walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warrior producer weren t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of it futuristic overtone on the other hand producer were right on the mark walter hill wa accused of actually promoting some disturbing trend that were quite visible in contemporary america to make the movie even more distant from future plot wa loosely based on anabasis historical book written by greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventure in ancient persia year ago instead of ancient persia movie begin in contemporary coney island where cleon dorsey wright leader of the warrior local youth gang get invitation to the great gathering of all youth gang from the city the gathering organised by gramercy park riff most powerful gang in the city is taking place in bronx that is far away from warrior home territory but small and unarmed delegation of the warrior get there safely thanks to the general truce on the gathering cyrus roger hill charismatic leader of the riff announces his grand plan to unite all the gang and take over the city crowd is enthusiastic but the small gang of rogue led by psychopathic luther david patrick kelly us the opportunity to assassinate cyrus police simultaneously raid the gathering and in the commotion warrior get blamed by the killing and their leader get killed by riff the remaining eight led by cleon s lieutenant swann michael beck must now try to get to coney island but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gang upon it release despite the controversy and even some youth riot that were allegedly inspired by it the warrior enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status however despite being one of the best movie of that year and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career the movie failed to leave a strong impression to the future generation a some other cinematic achievement of that same year the reason for that probably lie in a fact that this movie aged very quickly if walter hill s idea wa to warn the public about problem of urban america he failed miserably the future wa much worse than his vision the youth gang a presented in the warrior are far from shadowy army able to take over entire city their member seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feud than such prosaic and for the public more annoying matter like crime in their vocabulary word arm is reserved for small knife and blunt object and only few of them use heavy artillery like handgun they even have their own very strict and detailed law upheld more strictly than some government do with their own many people in american city would be more than happy to see their young criminal behaving like those in the warrior some of the critic who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot argument in their favour despite those objection the warrior have all the element of a very good film the plot is simple and serf a good basis for numerous action scene the fight are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic although there isn t much bloodshed or gore in the movie editing is superb event happen at quick pace with the exception of middle when boring moralistic exchange between swann and his would be girlfriend mercy deborah van valkenburgh drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable yet the trademark of this film are the actor who showed great talent although most of them later sunk into anonymity best known of them is david patrick kelly whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the role of psychopathic villain michael beck a cool almost statesman like leader of a gang is also very good and james remar give good contrast a his hot shot contender for top spot all in all this movie is perhaps dated yet in it hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movie

Sentence: bill condon s god and monster is a fascinating look into the last day in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classic frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since i wa unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whale s inner fantasy and hallucination whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror picture decided fifteen year before his death at age to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him a the film tell it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who wa working a the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly wa what many people refer to him a in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scene a young film enthusiast visit whale s home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answer the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale want when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesn t really think much of this much to the warning of his friend becoming more and more intrigued in the story whale tell him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale start to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life a he begin to seldom suffer mild stroke and moment of true catharsis god and monster is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who wa forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to a a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and find that many of the other attendee do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whale s first love in his life wa making movie and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life a played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale come off a a sad but dignified man and a person who wa not afraid to stand out from others just a long a he knew he wa being true to himself he never hid the fact that he wa gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it wa this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only thing of whale a a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it mean so much more to whale who see boone a sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a dead end job a a gardener of people s home whale view him a the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begin his feeling but one that will actually listen to him since whale life with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small element hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film doe not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story development but it is a little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two character are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two a the tension slowly build in lesser hand this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that help the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film wa not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether god and monster is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also play a a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from god and monster it wa ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one else s business in the first place

Sentence: i actually am a fan of the original or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mill twice a a pair of twin separated at birth by divorcing parent never to come in contact with the other so the parent never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remake especially of film i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake wa not originally on the top of my viewing list and wa actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney film are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it s actually good not the original good but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit a it doe become entertaining for the same exact reason the original wa entertaining because it s cute and innocent fun because it ha a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parent are also immensely appealing and i m repeating myself because it s cute and innocent fun there s nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twin and denying them the truth for year is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it s aimed directly at either kid adult who want to remember the original or young adult who want to remember what it wa like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movie wasn t so weird or diverse the name godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple year to see abc s wonderful world of disney where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friend and their mother to see all the rereleased disney film like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of child s animated half hour show made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldn t dare missing i can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap it s more of a late childhood movie because it deal with the issue of divorce but it deal with it in a disney ized version it s playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood i d probably dismiss it i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it wa to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibility of my seemingly perfect parent splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situation thing could always work out if you well manipulate thing a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it s also charming in it own way it ha a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick a tone that isn t corny or condescending but just right the moment that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kid actually know better than the foolish adult the story is basically classic by now repeated almost a many time a kurosawa s the seven samurai a pair of twin played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mill in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parent one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she life with her parent and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz a she work a a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sport and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie want to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which result in some nasty prank which wind them in seclusion together in a private out of the way cabin there they become friend then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch place so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother s life in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer come they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mill in the original but she come off just a appealing a she did once she doe though add a couple new thing she make the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also add on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake one accent aren t exactly perfect she s also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actor are especially in their first film she make a great protagonist and it only help that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn t been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what ha made him a notable actor in the past not just that he s mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning a maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film add another dimension and another angle to their character that wa amiss in the original during the opening credit we see glimpse from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film s more smarmy scene come off a actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way a in many such film this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since well the original film year ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it ha a form of intelligence and wit that make such plot point a an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who s deliciously tormented by the twin later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it take two starring the olsen twin because it treat the child a the smart one and the adult a the silly one not the other way around and because above everything it know exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scene work well but not nearly a well a they worked in the original i liked the way the parent fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flame getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawk cary grant film of yesteryear and a much a this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty wa far more stylized and just a suitable for adult audience a it wa for young audience a such this remake may never be nearly a great or classic a the original film but it at least know how to treat it source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effect without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyance

Sentence: it s terribly unfortunate that stir of echo tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of s unsung treasure the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two film are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience member last night and although they have eerily similar storyline stir of echo is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly ha been one of the major factor in it recent repeat business stir of echo is more conventional and predictable in it final twist and where the sixth sense wa disturbing stir of echo is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewer are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarity and will foolishly forget to judge this film on it own respectable merit adapted from a novel by richard matheson that wa written some forty year ago stir of echo open with a cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks doe it hurt to be dead apparently jake see the ghost of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn t the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom ha just discovered she is six week pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at a party with their closest friend tom convinces maggie s new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly work and before long tom is seeing thing he wouldn t normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six month seeking help from lisa she tell him that while he wa under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn t expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he see stir of echo isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in it portrayal of a struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe s dream with the fish are top notch and exceedingly believable a a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problem after tom is hypnotized and start seeing ghastly vision he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he ha seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead belief what tom say and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through doe not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood star like tom cruise and julia robert and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible a a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their job just to make end meet in a masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he see starting from his view a he close his eye into darkness lisa tell him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we a audience member are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen a a fuzzy word in black letter pop up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene a mesmerizing and brilliantly construed a this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wake up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he ha just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having load of fun with her small role a maggie s sister lisa illeana douglas s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature film funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas get to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom s vision of the girl she remark i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she s dead give one pause also of note are jenny morrison s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in s whatever a morrison s grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echo doe not live up to it obviously frightful full potential and it doesn t what come before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whisper and ghostly sound effect successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp prof once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situation that revolve around realistically written character stir of echo isn t a good a the sixth sense but why should it need to be both film are fully capable of standing on their own two foot and stir of echo really is a spinetinglingly good horror film

Sentence: contact is a film that try to do several different thing it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life to raise question about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr ellie arroway jodie foster and the religious spokesman palmer joss matthew mcconaughey the film succeeds wonderfully at it first two goal the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable albeit less immediately engaging than say the cold blooded destructiveness of the invader in independence day or even the complex process of abduction and genetic hybridization that form the ongoing plot line of tv s the x file the alien in contact seem to be like u they are more curious than anything else they know we exist they want u to know that they exist and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person the film wisely refrain from showing u the alien directly and between the character ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrial and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world that sense of wonder and mystery come through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick s a space odyssey most of the film however take place on earth where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these alien scientist are enthusiastic ultraconservative religious leader are wary and government official are caught somewhere in between the debate is fueled largely by dr arroway s atheism she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the alien have provided blueprint but many are wary of sending an atheist a humankind s representative to another specie the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these question especially when it reach a conclusion that suggests that the two approach science and faith could be viewed a complementary rather than diametrically opposed still the film fall a little short in it representation of this conflict a it exists in american society the two side are represented primarily by arroway and by far right fundamentalist but in reality probably of american are neither atheist nor far right fundamentalist palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motif and come across a a less than ideal spokesman for any ideology then again the film doe concentrate mostly on public debate which doe after all tend to be dominated by extremist rather than on dinner table or college dormitory discussion contact is accurate in it portrayal of these issue then but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself the film s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss for one thing it resort to the tired movie clich that two attractive people will immediately fall in love a soon a they appear on the screen together a there doe not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction the romance rarely if ever shed any light on the character although it occasionally try and fails joss s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement i guess you could say i m a man of the cloth but without the cloth for example is more like a punchline to a joke than character development instead the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot development granted this is a plot and idea driven film and the character are secondary but this just seemed like laziness on the writer part more than anything else the success of contact however far outweigh it failure even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether which it didn t the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film contact doesn t quite cover all the base but it cover about a much a one could hope for in a two hour film and it rejection of big budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable and i would not be surprised if ten year from now contact is mentioned in the same breath a and blade runner a one of the finest example of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction

Sentence: i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various film mixed into an entirely different film however the edge ha done something that most action film should do and that is add heart and character we like to the plot in doing so the edge draw many more suspenseful moment out of cliched scene than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moment we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprise to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the gut to add it to his script action film are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining u they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror film have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild wa one of the best action suspense film i have seen from the s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic character is nearly unmatched to this day the edge ha the intelligence and smart character but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it wa very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliche and plot hole this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around a in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minute intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survival of the fittest film but taking scream s lead the edge make fun of the genre s cliche and then us them though not quite a effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonder what the accumulation of all this knowledge ha brought to him for once we don t immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take picture of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob a action film go these item do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob want to find a native to shoot picture of because of his personality charles bob bob s assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and a shown in the preview hit a flock of bird flying south for the winter down the plane go the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore ha to create original way to approach the situation he succeeds often enough for u to enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this ha been done many time in film with different animal and even bear but given the charles intelligence and bob s uncertainty many of the cliche are given fresh twist even charles himself seems to have seen these action film before my favorite line of the film come from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t a it seems anymore i have to write cautiously a to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first two third of the edge have many humorous moment to push it along and some of charles survival technique seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the character lose all sensibility i have always wondered why character in film walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear make your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the character and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical detail are awkward such a the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needle the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and border on phenomenal anthony hopkins give a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his role but here he exceeds at gaining the audience sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lamb alec baldwin give one of his best performance i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer elle give a good performance albeit slight she isn t in the film all that much but for the scene she doe have she handle a an actress not a a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scene are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of u are used to but too many cliche bog it down director tamahori ha created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled part david mamet s script though ha a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high strung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart

Sentence: there are some work of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpiece is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one it popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remake that were made in more than half a century since it premiere but also in countless tribute and reference that movie maker use in their work to this day casablanca is also a movie that ha the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critic and loved by general audience one of the thing that make this film even more unique wa the fact that it wa doomed to fail at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of it time it wa based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn t been produced on stage screenplay by three writer julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch wa beeing written a shooting went along the main actor were producer second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz wa considered to be capable but not great director however the movie wa commercially successful and earned three oscar including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in it own golden age the plot of the movie wa heavily influenced by the need of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstance of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousand of refugee from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visa many shady character thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rain his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and life by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything change when he get in possession of two precious extra visa this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugee to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three time from nazi concentration camp and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple need visa especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actor who elevated his persona to the star status bogart s portrayal of rick a complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present wa so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbol of that era of filmmaking some happier time when the romance on the screen didn t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary work for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn t the romance itself it s the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choice in their life the casting of casablanca wa right on target not just in a case of main lead the supporting actor also did a marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john huston s maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original character another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid a the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo ha believable charisma and look like a somebody who could inspire million of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaf little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rain in a role of a lifetime wa embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rain managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rain also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movie to death discovered sign of homosexuality in renault s relationship towards rick and rick s final word leave room for even more outrageous speculation together with well drawn character and exciting story the movie wa good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpicker would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracy but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we don t see it a a historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment a well a infinite inspiration

tell u the original concept behind fantasia wa to bring it out every year with some old segment retained and some new segment added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty year have passed since the original classic wa released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it wa first released in grossing somewhere close to in it original month of release subsequent re release of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it ha finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate

third segment and the least of the eight segment is set to george gershwin s rhapsody in blue this segment is designed a a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different story about sad soul living in depression era new york there s a construction worker who dream of being a jazz drummer an out of work sad sack that dream of having a job a young girl that dream of spending time with her parent instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dream of being free from his overbearing wife i won t go into how everything work out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drag quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segment segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s piano concerto no and is an animated version of han christian andersen s the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier fall in love with a wind up clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester the jester knock the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little doe the jester know the soldier ha been deposited in the sewer and ha journeyed through the pipeline only to be swallowed by a fish that ha been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldier that the one legged one come from the soldier eventually save the day and get the girl although the ending ha been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some child may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saint saens the carnival of the animal this segment feature a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingo with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligator and hippo dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and it s the one that people remember most the sorcerer s apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film considering it wa shot full frame and exhibit large amount of grain there were at least two occasion where image were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problem crop up on modern day release when projected on screen too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theater segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck star a an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animal onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventure mainly involving donald being crushed by animal in various manner despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it display more emotion in it final scene than many of the tear jerker foisted on audience these day powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky s the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape tree bloom and flower blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rear back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in it path including everything that the sprite ha worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollar a ticket alone although brush stroke are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segment are largely no pun intended throwaway although steve martin s clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credit for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gag seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment come from of all people bette midler who get to tell u about some of the abandoned segment that never made it off of the drawing board piece like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horseman set to wagner s ride of the valkyrie and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never wa shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installment for fan of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material a i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollar seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after it run in imax theater it is going to be brought out in regular theater i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whale triangle thing sprite can fly g

Sentence: star war episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movie evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star war the original blockbuster film and it two sequel not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but ha deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more american today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so year after the release of the original and year since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star war film withstand the weight of incomparable expectation and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of character possibly compete with the legend of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icon against this challenge the fourth star war film episode one the phantom menace hit the screen last week and despite some early critical review in the major medium the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star war film the phantom menace take place decade before the setting of original film a the film open obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star war is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinni liam neeson the republic government ha sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that ha developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiation but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the part they need but display uncanny intelligence insight and instinct qui gon sens the child is unusually strong with the force and begin to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force a anyone who ha watched the original star war trilogy know far from being a galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matter further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sound a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of character and an immediate crisis but set up the foundation for the event that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knight anakin s turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story move quickly with the only drawback being that many question predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reason the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it s unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movie were clearly luke s story with the story centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s if this trilogy is centered on anakin it s a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actor lack the subtle acting skill of adult performer and a a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast doe fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect a an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast a obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fit the role of a young queen well but her line were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the character but the interaction between them individually the character in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star war and the storyline is not more confusing than previous film in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn t do a good of a job playing the character off one another in star war there were immediate contrast and memorable exchange between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitude and personality in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four character in the way they react to the immediate problem and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the character and their relationship with each other individually they are interesting character with clear motivation and interest but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it ha disappointed many reviewer but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful element of lucas previous film make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the character visit magical underwater city evade dinosaur sized sea monster fight battle droids and menacing destroyer on venetian looking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settle for vague idea about the look of his setting he creates rich spectacular landscape palace and skyline most of the new special effect in his re released special edition trilogy in were change that allowed him to give the earlier movie the look and feel that just weren t possible when the film were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creature robot with personality and a supporting cast of alien who interact with the main character the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother a slave watto ha a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wing that flutter like a hummingbird a he float around the room of all the computer generated character in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated character no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minute of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumble his way into the path of the jedi knight early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film lightening scene with his mishap and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the character throughout the film a if he were really on the set with the actor however despite the technological magic that make his character possible jar jar isn t completely convincing he still move and sound too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he s there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar wa a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star war movie is that the film is replete with humor and small detail that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film s struggle between good and evil and the sober musing about one s destiny and the force like all star war film the phantom menace never take itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his film are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lot of half hidden joke and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace work because a in all his film there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battle hair raising chase and thrilling duel between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scene in any star war film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas ha filmed the phantom menace won t win any major oscar it probably won t beat titanic s box office record and it s not even the best star war film i d put it third after the original and the empire strike back but it s an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can t live up to it s hype no film not even the original star war could have done that but it s still worth seeing probably more than once

Sentence: cinematically speaking gordon park original is not a great film a bit slow at time and more than a little rough around the edge a it build to it climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman s black private dick that s a sex machine to all the chick to the big screen hardly qualifies a groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly year after it original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the film s connection with moviegoer far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stem from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his as this fact also explains why john singleton s yg revival of john shaft is a enjoyable a it is much like the film that started the franchise this s plot doesn t score point in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thriller contrary to what ha been reported over the past few month this is not a remake of the original film but more of a sequel spinoff the star audience know and love from the original film and it first two sequel s and s richard roundtree once again play john shaft who still run a private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lie on his same named nephew samuel l jackson who a the film begin is a cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaf him at odds with his superior when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaf the force and decides to take matter into his own hand a a p i but that s easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is people hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime people or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson s way toward commanding this film people is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stage however he isn t so funny a to make the character come off a goofy and buffoonish and people eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that s exactly what wright doe and make it seem effortless then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson s impressive star turn doesn t quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co star bale ha already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in so it only follows that his performance a a similar less exaggerated character would be spot on collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight a the frightened conflicted diane busta rhyme brings some good laugh a shaft s sidekick rasaan registering not a strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams a tough narcotic cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also ha little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credit aside his shaft doesn t even have one sex scene that singleton once again prof his ability with actor is an especially good thing since he s not really an action director this is not to say that he doe a bad job with the numerous gunfight and the requisite foot and car chase they move well a doe the film a a whole and are reasonably exciting it s just that there s nothing terribly inventive about them these set piece are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional but if there s anything that a movie doe well it s make the familiar look cool and this keep that tradition alive from the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkle throughout the film on the film look great and easily sweep the viewer into it world with it energetic bravado even a common visual trick such a employing fancy wipe for scene transition not only feel unforced it feel necessary style doesn t exactly make for a great film but when it come to that s of little consequence what matter above all else is having a good time and the latest should be just the first of many fun ride to be had with this bad mutha shut

Sentence: is it just me or have disney film gradually lost their appeal i wa almost stunned by the quality of who framed roger rabbit a fun unique look at a world where cartoon and people lived together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animation from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wan na be s is getting to me you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekick the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy song a few in joke for adult and the occasional out of place warner brother coyote fall off the cliff type joke it s a formula and like any formula it get tiresome that s why i m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution right to the work of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio from what i ve seen of their movie kiki s delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audience are in for a treat these movie particularly kiki s delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki s delivery service start with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecast of clear sky decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isn t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training a a witch her mother is also a witch and a thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parent treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audience but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki s mother act a a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she ha been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she s discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skill a a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she us her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossom into her working a a courier a one person delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn t seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of fault and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one ha something about them some interest or trait that make them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizen is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely look impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern need of the s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozen are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i won t suffice it to say that many of these minor detail could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorite are kiki s relationship with the baker s husband although he s quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scare her his kindness win her friendship in the garage of a deliveree s house can be found a vintage model t two old lady have a relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such detail give the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crash down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this cause kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki come to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don t even want to hint at it the ending of the movie ha a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment i ve ever seen if you don t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steer free of many of the disney convention there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny line and scene however i would be surprised if disney doesn t give jiji more joke or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted a habit disney movie have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty wa derived from a person s inside and wa then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desire for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movie is in the style of animation for kiki s delivery service not a colorful and dynamic a disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fit the movie to a t this is particularly true with scene of kiki s flight the extreme realism of the bird in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and help these scene capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i ve ever seen i m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united state disney tentatively plan a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli film after that i d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak season with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it s good to know that it s being released at all for kiki s delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bite dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie i ve ever seen

is not very prevalent in movie today inundated a we are with film which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brook film while the dialog will not be a oppressive a in some of the independent talk film which are finding their way into theater the situation in which his character find themselves are one we can often identify with but even if we can t brook ha the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenager and jim carrey fan probably won t find an albert brook movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brook comedy is intelligent mother is albert brook latest film and it doe not disappoint brook play john henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he make an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then ha dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sport agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff ha a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witness a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hint at a fault in john and his career every time she talk with him and john give it right back to her at the end of one of their conversation where beatrice ha just picked apart john s life she say i love you and john reply with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticism but instead give them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it s the kind that go something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems a though nothing he doe make her happy there s always the big but john belief that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationship with woman either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out woman who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he come to the conclusion that since his problem are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kind of feeling come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he call it brook own brand of humor really shine in this film especially in the interaction john ha with his mother there s a scene where john ha just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel she still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glance at the life his mother lead when she try to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buy in great quantity and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john point out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tell him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he s also surprised at the variety of item beatrice keep in the refrigerator such a a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer wa a good invention say john but it s not supposed to be used for everything that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator it s something most of u find strangely familiar brook is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep s character are in a comedy club having a discussion when they re finished and walk out brook cut to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don t know what the joke wa because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minute it seemed so out of context in this film brook us the same trick a couple of time to open or close a scene i don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just a well a they have in the past john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we a the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but a john spends more time with her we learn thing about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit a enjoyable a the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brook doe an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often belief he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way he s very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds a beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character this only help the audience to share the frustration john feel when dealing with her a his first choice brook originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who wa beginning to show symptom of alzheimer s disease that may be just a well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also doe a good job at playing the younger brother who ha always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed a a mama s boy the only thing that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot hole a solid connection is not really made between john s trouble and his reason for living with his mother additionally the end result of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goal and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think i m some kind of moron john no i think your someone who think i m a moron beatrice well it take one to know one

don t mean to say that his technique are not creative or good looking but he simply us the best tool for the job it shouldn t have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie s title is another name for the dalai lama which mean ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic vision to embellish the literal story one of which make an interesting statement pay attention to the film s opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two year old his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lama who have gone before several item belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other item the child is asked if he recognizes any of the item a his own the boy pick correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child wa taking his cue from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetan were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised a the reincarnation of the lama s spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be ground for a call to social service but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keep him from becoming a genuinely likeable well rounded person certain pattern take shape over the year for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radio clock and telescope are some of his favorite toy when he is old enough to accept his leadership he make plan to modernize isolated tibet he also ha a soft spot for creature who are suffering or in pain including herd animal it s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet s gigantic neighbor china tibet and it leader prove correct in fearing china a first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the army come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama s life is in danger if he stay the movie end when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaf tibet for india the story doesn t lead up to a cinematic climax a strongly a most feature film do it just doesn t fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven year in tibet which is good in it own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the character and event not vice versa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestment and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant color is shown throughout the movie the robe and hat of state are bright red and gold the brick are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetan even the touchstone picture logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he wa the perfect choice for those who don t know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building block are lot of small note tiny grain of music which are first grouped then repeated in pattern these pattern create interesting texture which are themselves part of a larger composition people won t be flocking to kundun for it s great ending or talking about it outstanding plot but it doe have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sight rich cinematography and innovative music it give interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and take a warm look at the dalai lama a a person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who give the film a strong beautiful consistent look

Sentence: i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star war installment than what you see in the commercial but there isn t george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant special effect bound flick and he ha done it again this is the first star war film i ve seen on the big screen so of course the impact wa much greater than when i watched the three original episode on video what is compelling about the phantom menace is not it disposable story but it amazing visuals basically the film s plot is centered around trade dispute between two planet qui gon liam neeson and his young apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor set out with the animated jar jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war when their ship break down and they are stranded they find a young boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his slave mother qui gon strongly belief that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately take him under his wing anakin participates in a heart pounding podrace one of the highlight of the film to get the equipment needed to fix qui gon s ship however most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy meanwhile queen amadala natalie portman is frustrated and at wit s end being na ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulder there are hardly any emotional scene in the film even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training the frenzied excitement of the whole film wear down the poignancy to the size of a crumb this doe not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made in all the star war film human emotion that we the audience can identify with are usually nil but the film are for pure enjoyment not for uplifting purpose despite the fun of watching the movie the phantom menace is not without flaw for starter we have the ill conceived moronic character jar jar binks who should be considered a threat to star war galactic society and to the audience what a klutz george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be a memorable a say yoda r d or c po but ala his effort were in vain secondly this may be good or bad depending on your point of view the movie s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic book feel of the previous three star war installment this is due perhaps to the utter complexity to this movie s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effect used here the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportion i can t say much about the acting though acting ha never been what you saw star war movie for anyway however there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performance they are straightforward and at time stale natalie portman ha a great presence but her turn a queen amadala make the queen a stoic unfeeling enigma there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make u believe the trade predicament is anything of importance jake lloyd is the only actor here who ha an ounce of evident spunk despite the inevitable fault there is so much to enjoy about the movie the heightened excitement of the final sequence doesn t quite surpass the famous the empire strike back climactic scene but they are amazing and edge of your seat fun in their own rite the film is a treasure to look at the visual effect are astonishing of the time the awe inspiring mouth opening eye popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effect genius not since s the fifth element ha there been a film a drenched in visual treat a this one the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element the previous star war movie kubrick s maybe even of fritz lang s classic silent metropolis however all the set are so original the original star war movie can t even match the grandeur of this film s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer it give u hope of even greater thing for the upcoming episode the costume are remarkable and have jean paul gaultier written all over them whether it queen amadala s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold embroidery and feather or the jedis simple brown uniform the costume designer ha fused talent with outrageousness the costume are one of the true delight of watching the movie a for john williams score i don t think he s done one a complex or powerful since i can t even remember it is a epic a his schindler s list score and a thrilling and zestful a jaw it includes the bare bone of his music from the previous three film but williams ha added on made the music much more intense and moving what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie one might come in with high expectation and be disappointed there is very little to hate in the film it s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick it is the best fun film and the best big budget film out today most definitely

Sentence: here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop okay it isn t quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit specie but it certainly is smart most film of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b horror film from the s and s and some even become them however a we learned with the small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectation can be shattered a lot of criticism ha gone against this film from what i have read so far anyway yep all two review and it make me wonder why these type of film are automatically dismissed a gory laughable piece of trash but the thing is it isn t it s well made well acted and quite intelligent i can see most of the critic now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film but the specie series isn t about the lack of these element it s about how much it can get into one film and yet behind it all it ha this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so specie ii begin in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe many film especially sci fi one create similar timeline a our realistic one but change it to fit the film s need specie ii begin with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mar aboard is patrick ross justin lazard a very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just want patrick to succeed well it would seem that he ha succeeded landing on the surface of mar he is the first human being to ever do so of course he isn t the first ever about a billion year ago an alien specie supposedly landed on mar and destroyed the perfect living condition that were able to sustain life now of course the red planet is cold and rocky no life life on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collect sample from the ground he take them aboard and put them in storage unfortunately one of the sample contains a form of life and it get loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior to heading back to earth this life form creep along the floor and inhabits the earthling they pas out for approximately seven minute and then shrug it off a nothing because they can t even remember they blame it on a technical malfunction back on earth patrick begin to have strong urge to mate with a many woman a possible a we know from the original this is because the alien want to breed and take over the planet however the child that are bred are half human a their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he find it in eve natasha henstridge eve wa cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urge have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from specie and her motif seem respectable since she wa involved with the original alien attack she want to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it ha story wise specie ii is much stronger than it predecessor but it is also much stronger than say alien hey i love the film but you can t tell me it wa strong on story what surprised me the most with this film wa the incorporation of historical fact into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mar which landed in one of the pole this piece of rock contained fossil which may have been proof of life on mar later it wa proven that it wa not a living creature that created it the script us this effectively but also manages to provide a well balanced plot beginning with the first man on mar something i have always dreamed of seeing i wa hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie and it doe it quite well the character are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he doe there are the obvious flaw of course mostly lying in the technical aspect the special effect are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mother gave birth to alien child also the most realistic one are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone s head being blown off however some plot element also may elicit laugh from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the specie series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however i tend to disagree what were the alien film about and if an alien specie ever did come to earth and their sole purpose wa to destroy u wouldn t you mate a quickly a possible with a many people a possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick go searching for a mate in a grocery store i didn t realize that alien were that picky on choosing woman to mate with i just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is a vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it wa bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it wa good it would have asked for comparison with film like alien okay so it isn t that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting a his over the top impersonation of a general make him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around a she is usually enclosed in a cage however she doe manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she s quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is so so but he isn t annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell ha a small part but he make it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor a i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increase in likeability mykelti williamson give an enjoyable performance and he give the film a more down to earth feel and of course justin lazard lazard ha so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective sure he is wooden but isn t that what his character is like the moment when he touch the glass separating henstridge from him wa extremely well done due to the couple s acting specie ii is rated r for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language this is definitely an r rated film that young kid should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmare and never have sex for the rest of their life hell i don t even know if i will what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turn out to be the surprise film of the year i probably won t see another film where i wa expecting so little and got so much for quite a while director peter medak ha crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series medak ha also mastered the wonderful jump moment and ha probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still ha the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a sure handed director specie ii is exactly what these film should be entertaining

the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or wa the center of tv s world the world where our protagonist life combine all these name and concept into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman lead the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality come under attack one day when a studio light fall from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jam and he start picking up a voice that exactly describes his movement he is so distracted that he nearly hit a pedestrian when the radio come back to normal the announcer warns listener to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddity the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and try to take the elevator the elevator door open up on a small lounge with people on coffee break a grip see truman him and quickly move a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guard grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it get even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it s best not to think about it she say trying vainly to change truman s memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program his action are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the all seeing creator of truman s world doe his best to keep him unaware and happy it s sort of like westworld told from the robot point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaur point of view we root for the captive of the cage world our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting question such a the ethic of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life ha all been fake although these question came to mind i don t think the film itself asked them it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them i wa particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didn t see it that way perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t but it seems like there were some missed opportunity here but on it own term the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scene are all apparently shot from hidden camera with snoot and obstruction covering the corner of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led number obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and scored the film open with what sound like family drama theme music when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie end the score sound more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates truman s scene of suspicion and awakening glass ha a small cameo a a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story wa brisk there wa no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title card a few interview and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scene is of the studio light falling there wa no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it fall apart because it wasn t necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it s a quick straight shot to the movie s end in term of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca both film are well made with interesting story set in interesting world but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great idea neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccol s next film whatever it may be

Sentence: and i thought stigma would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turn out i wa wrong because while stigma wa merely boring and self important end of day is completely inept on all front it s a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man ha ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn t count is no fun at all end of day is a major stinker the movie open in vatican city some catholic priest have observed an ancient prophecy which say that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope order protection of this girl though some priest believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty year later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem now working a a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest lead him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing element of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priest looking to kill her there are so many problem with this film it s hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this wa a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold ha neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotion in other word trying to give him dimension wa a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed hero but not schwarzenegger there are several scene that attempt to establish jericho s character one ha him contemplating suicide another cry over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil try to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back none of these scene really work because arnie isn t up to the task the filmmaker would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the like of which schwarzenegger ha excelled in before this one isn t at all believable the way arnold play him the supporting cast try their hardest and only gabriel byrne make any impact at all a the prince of darkness he s suave and confident he act like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script ha him doing thing that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him a a powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it cause the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne s speech about the bible being overrated actually start to make sense mainly because arnold s attempt at refuting it mostly of the ti not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold ha to win so in the end nobody really care kevin pollack play jericho s security guard sidekick and try to liven thing up with some comic aside but like most bad action movie sidekick he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting player are good actor but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performance aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which start off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it s utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year s eve because it s exactly year after the year of the devil which isn t it turn out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add a to the beginning and you ve got if you don t buy this explanation you re not alone it s convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she s christine see and she life in new york see and if that weren t bad enough there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all why can satan kill everyone he pass on the street but when it come to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he s powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can t control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monk deal with time zone in their prophecy a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but it s never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean don t get me started on the time paradox offered up by the terminator movie but this time the plot inconsistency stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of day complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat wa doing in there it get so formulaic that it s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eye at the precise moment a boo will come their prediction will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequence are utterly charmless partially because we don t care about these character due to the script s pathetic attempt at characterization and setup and also because they too don t make any sense there s a scene where schwarzenegger get thrown around a room by a little old lady it s good for a few chuckle but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now ha super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never set that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequence are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of day is not only silly and confusing but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also mean that not a single scene in end of day go by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience go numb scene aren t connected through any reasonable mean so a lot of the time stuff get blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reason to hell with reason let s just blow stuff up isn t it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it s dull interminable and unrelenting in it stupidity perhaps arnold need to make some movie with james cameron to revive his career because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here end of day might have had camp value if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmaker should have come up with a decent script if it s going to be campy arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously i didn t actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack a it stand end of day is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that

Sentence: die hard is an altogether unfortunate fiasco inferior to the original in every respect place the blame squarely on the shoulder of steven de souza and doug richardson who wrote the film s pathetic screenplay every line of dialogue reek of either smarmy sap or forced humor the plot is altogether implausible the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorist who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower leaving a dozen plane stranded in the air waiting to land the film ha zero credibility and all of the character come off a cliched cardboard cut out so much for the script how about the action well let s put it this way director renny harlin could learn a few thing from john mctiernan who directed the original a well a the hunt for red october and predator all standouts for their hair raising suspense by contrast harlin doesn t have a clue when it come to choreographing action and consequently die hard never pick up steam die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute in fact the movie often seems deliberately campy and it almost reach the threshold of being so bad it s good you do laugh but you laugh at the film not with it die hard should have never been cleared for takeoff

that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter i chuckled incessantly all the way home let me share the skull is a secret society conceived inside the wall of yale designed i m sure to mirror the actual skull bone from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlight the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he find himself surrounded by beautiful woman driving a new car and marveling at the that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstance become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe a a drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offer it share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately the skull is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it s just another abysmal teen prototype that ha the soundtrack the star but not the script the skull is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howler first off upon their initiation into the skull each new member ha to have a skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently cover up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society wa being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new member like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters gee why not member t shirt but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skull doe not bother with individual agree or disagree notion when making collective decision they are given official skull paddle when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way mean a disagreement wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddle for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong i m still chuckling about these ludicrous detail but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combine a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawson s creek crowd and fuse the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actor like craig t nelson a skull chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson a fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricature and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there s christopher mcdonald who ha the capacity to be a fun exciting actor mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here a he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue make it a hat trick i pray it wa a snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actor the young troupe of performer involved fair moderately better let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blue is bland but passable a caleb mandrake the judge s son walker preserve a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who play luke s longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boil down to the actor attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cage them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to a decent set up from director rob cohen who film early sequence with a sense of atmosphere and style it make you wonder why he didn t flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight aren t superior cinema they belong on the afi top list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skull get little accomplished the thrill and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlook the cool potential of a secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skull a an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that ha developed barnacle from excessive usage we ve seen it all before and better the skull is a feeble little circus of stupidity so miscalculated that while it would serve a a clever pun a term like boneheaded seems just too generous

Sentence: it s difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishment to date are a handful of award winning tv commercial a is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes that said hayes s feature film debut life up to expectation coming off mainly a equal part offensive and moronic but occasionally bubble boy transcends it substandard root with glimmer of humor and scathing social commentary those moment of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film s two star jake gyllenhall a the immuno deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz a his over protective hyper religious reagan loving mother gyllenhall s sweet natured delivery of jimmy s hilariously na ve narration serf a the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming of age story jimmy is a bubble boy a kid born without immunity who could die if he come in contact with a single germ a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld his mom home school jimmy filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti sexual message until he s befriended by chloe marley shelton the beautiful girl next door jimmy fall in love with chloe but is afraid that his love will literally kill him a evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly try to enter his bubble for a kiss but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend jimmy build a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks addled cross country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love the offensive bit have little to do with jimmy s rare handicap regardless of what the film s protester would have you believe but instead center on outrageous racial stereotype including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi but even if you find stereotype humor funny it s hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gag they even manage to bungle some potentially great moment with a group of carnival freak but a few of the harsh jab manage to work especially in the case of kurtz who very bluntly show the dark hypocritical side of the religious right and a wacky send up of a cult called bright n shiny led by the inimitable fabio unfortunately a few giggle can t make bubble boy the riotous off the wall comedy it so desperately want to be honestly it s a mystery how on earth this movie wa ever made and i m not just saying that because it s so mediocre how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actor that doesn t seem to appeal to any particular demographic and ha the potential to offend so many and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parent of real life bubble boy david philip vetter maybe disney s wondering the same thing hope the opening box office take make it worthwhile

try to vary word description of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative term and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and can not comprehend fret not it s most likely just another way of referring to sex i think we d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review though not a boring a the movie which make steve forbes flat tax plan seem a lively a watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongo while high on god know what body shot is a film so frightened of coitus that scene of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you d normally expect to see a violent attack it s about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are thing we all do sometimes the character in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicity of sexual act their life center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it s a if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek at it core body shot is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church group showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping ugli a if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say his character don t communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer give them an opportunity to let out their inner thought by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitude like i like to come or sex without love equal violence huh and yes that is a complex a this movie s observation get the character are stupid and shallow with not one registering a anything more the plot concern vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such event we meet the character a they speak directly to u confiding in u with their idiotic rumination on intimacy i would normally go into the character and the actor who play them giving you the pro and con but for this film i can not i m not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston a a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breast defined ab pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin i vaguely recall brad rowe a the sensitive one only because his character get the worst line sex without love equal violence in between all the confessional cristoffer film everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mo and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffle me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that it tag line claim to be defining if body shot is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f k obsessed fine i don t have any problem with a film that try to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only give u one side additionally that one side isn t even entertaining the character indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter take place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive character they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ala if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn t it erotic it isn t real it doesn t feel like an authentic sexual encounter every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shot make fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it show u none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show u why it character love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaf u with several tedious plot line to follow the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred the film show u two separate version of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both version the young actress playing the possible victim get her shirt torn off this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serf me i can t think of one film that ha done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movie of the s next to wall street unfortunately nobody give u reason to care not the writer the director or the actor nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie night in a manner similar to what cristoffer doe here though boogie night succeeded it wa similarly moralistic but it gave u two different viewpoint it showed u how the lifestyle of porn enticed it character and it showed u the possible fall out of such a decision the character in boogie night were a idiotic a the character are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer give them nothing but raging hormone he preaches to u by using his character to preach to u this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct a public service announcement on the peril of hittin

Sentence: meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood scream the television ad for hanging up disastrously written by real life sister delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focus on middle sister meg ryan and give her two co star lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameo but they don t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minute and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion eve mark meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in year ha just recently been put into the hospital in the final stage of what i assume is alzheimer s even though the film never enlightens u on exactly what is wrong with him while eve s relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her child year ago she ha had her fair share of up s and down s with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress interestingly their profession are given but we not once ever see them working at their job or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult life gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan a it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable minute catastrophe that feel like it three hour long if you are able to get through the opening half hour in which phone ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating self involved pat on the back how could a comedy drama that ha the star power of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different way issue from the past involving the possible jealousy each ha had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isn t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that come off a nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sister have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little child you can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to term with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food fight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credit meg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than s hurlyburly or s when a man love a woman despite her various detractor who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedy with hanging up the only thing she need to do is completely sever her filmmaking tie with nora ephron a writer director hack who shouldn t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even if she knew what she wa making wa not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scene that work flashback to christmas when she had a heartbreaking run in with her mother and to halloween when lou crashed her son s birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situation diane keaton a georgia is better a an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment what is more than a little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpse we get at them a child she is no more than five year ryan s senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow ha been wasted once again in a big screen venture after her even more thin role in s analyze this kudrow isn t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isn t her fault she doesn t register until a few quiet moment sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time a in her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work in s the opposite of sex if you are a fan of kudrow s and who isn t do yourself a favor and rent this gem that put more good use to kudrow in sixty second than hanging up doe in it entirety a eve s hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that give him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman a with ryan and matthau make a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg a a rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas flashback manages one of the few laugh in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotion displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the character aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brat if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credit are over saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportion

movie not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but cigarette actually ha no redeeming quality whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video it is december and the big party is at monica s martha plimpton house but no one ha arrived yet her invited guest and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the street of new york city in various group some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica and some are total stranger but they all are to face their own personal neurosis before night s end those who are invited are the one that have the issue it is up to those who aren t to help them come to term first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland character in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela

affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfection he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future a he is in law school his lack of flaw is both boring unrealistic

venture out of their usual location in search of the party that they just can t find paradoxically it is punk that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but aren t successful who guide them through their fear and force a level of relaxation upon their warped mind of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couple only one approach a level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movie s creator have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friend and share the common bond of being dateless paul ha just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to term with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to these two character is that they seem to want to be more than friend and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening finally there are the two worst performance and worst sub plot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before while she attempt to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male a he attempt to deal with a string of one night stand that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when a film is a putrid a this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film ha neither the quality of cinematography nor the moment of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cut bad continuity and inaccuracy first and most noticeable is that a the film go from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other time object seem to get up and move and hairstyle and costume change from shot to shot there are also at least scene in a taxi cab that go from start to finish not in a single one of them doe anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there wa a ray of a hope for these many bad plot perhaps if the maker had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end but it didn t happen that way the cast of quality name actor wa forced into role that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it

orange haven t yet gotten around to seeing the th man or turkish delight i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s a touching a schwarzenegger s in t that movie wa violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pic it violence seemed to be there for a purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minute of robocop wherein the lead villain toy with a cop before snuffing him he torture the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic it s a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively set the tone for the film that could be designated a splatter punk noir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up he impales a co worker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced a a smug genius the kind who s always impeccably dressed and race a sport car while generic rock tune blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film ha him pull a shift into a psychotic movie monster the kind who just won t die hollow man s protagonist are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting a if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst line i ve lost cohesion again they re a typical aaron spelling couple good looking but a vacant a george w bush s republican national convention speech i e bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end to what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd the rest of the film s character are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animal insulting one and other with a series of strained one liner is it just me or have labored insult become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique ahh what a cynical time we live in a the picture open we meet cain bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientist on a top secret so top secret the government ha only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at they ve performed several experiment on animal and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the film s s late show origin to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglect to let the pentagon in on his plan and somehow get two of his co worker to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complication then he inexplicably it s hinted that the process of invisibility ha made the animal into more savage creature but this is never explored and if that wa the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human begin raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s film that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lack any trace of wit insight and make no statement other than audience will pay for anything these day it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrill a minute ride verhoeven ha instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the preview make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self a couple week ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friend and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flick never go so far a to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy good but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feel icky and uncomfortable the director keep his camera trained at his nubile actress caressing their breast with his lens all while faux psycho music strain in the background it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it s funny that with all the technology million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply a gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein character do stupid thing just so the villain can pop up for more attack in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victim don infer red glass that track his body heat a in every mad slasher film we get the killer pov a scene where he spy on his neighbor while she undress triggered unpleasant memory of party massacre and lot of scene where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy it happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who look like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pause are you looking at me she query obviously haunted it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effect set to a plot that should have run it course by the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effect are so stunning they alone keep this from being a bad a urban legend or i still know what you did last summer and they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably a a mid week bargain rental you ve been warned but you probably won t listen will you ti a pity

Sentence: tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movie to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic area it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it s not bad in the way great colossal misfire like heaven s gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drip off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it wa made in the first place with all the good script lying around hollywood un produced how doe needless drek like this make it way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed character in all of motion picture history he ha appeared in over forty film which have ranged from the very good s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the ape down to the really bad s tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these film were just cheapie b movie made in the thirty and forty starring ex olympic athlete and a lot of cutsie chimp therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the mi guided audacity to sexualize the story a a vehicle for bo derek s bare breast tarzan and the lost city on the other hand ha absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storyline and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about a formulaic and generic a they come comic book have better plot than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that wa so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy george of the jungle didn t the producer think to leave that back in the old weissmuller picture where it belongs the story start with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tell of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by ape and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie start in he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologist grave robber named nigel raven steve waddington begin hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa s last great secret the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuse to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaf she change her mind and track him down therefore assuring lot of lame smooch scene between her and her ape man once the film get going in it own sluggish way it delf into a series of jungle adventure a tarzan jane and the native attempt the thwart raven and his crew from discovering the city most of the so called adventure are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequence stolen from innumerable recent adventure movie ranging from raider of the lost ark to the goony when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeace friendly scene of tarzan freeing caged animal releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusk into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who wa raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do instead he tie a tourniquet around his arm and stumble off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with the special effect are not worthy of a made for tv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunter had to slog through numerous underground cavern to get to the lost pyramid when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn t even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance come real close this movie prof what starship trooper only hinted at he can not act but he sure look well groomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the make up department wa thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington make a decent villain although he s like a charmless version of belloq from raider of the lost ark a jane the ex model jane march ha little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she doe fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunter a time or two but whenever a snake come into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in idea both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short

Sentence: i went to blair witch project book of shadow with the highest of hope the original film released last summer wa genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to it predecessor unfortunately my hope were soon dashed a the movie open the audience is shown pseudo documentary clip of burkittsville maryland resident being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town a a result of the original blair witch project movie it s a mostly humorous self aware poke at the medium hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sell blair witch related memorabilia from his website the movie then cut to a title that informs u that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that wa selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only find in bad horror movie we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette smoking doctor luridly leer above him we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall a a fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scene are barely referred to again i had a sinking feeling during these opening scene generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interior and evil doctor is a sure sign that you are in the throe of a truly horrible movie the movie cut again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan a in the first movie the character name are identical to the actor name although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there s no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the wood that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sell on his website we meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience steven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand belief that there may be some truth to the rumor of supernatural occurrence she is wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feel nauseated i knew immediately that the character wa pregnant and my intuition wa confirmed a few scene later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did i know because in bad movie nauseated woman are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eye who want to prove that the blair witch wa a good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery kim is dressed completely in black ha extreme goth style makeup on and occasionally display seemingly psychic ability but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it s never explained the party of five head off into the wood a promised they reach the crumbling ruin of the foundation of rustin parr s house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night s event there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site a well but after a few word are exchanged the rival group huff off and make camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minute showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun go down sexual innuendo are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wake up and discovers that their camera equipment ha been completely trashed and that steven and tristen s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shred like snow the videotape are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotape buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tape were found ooh spooky the team go back to jeffrey s house a creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the wood to regroup and review the tape they soon discover that the tape mysteriously skip five hour of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen start having weird dream in which she is the blair witch everybody start finding these weird rune like burn mark on their body steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucination and everything pretty much go to hell in a handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotape which seem to have some kind of weird image on them at about the point that the time jump eventually tristen wanders in mutter something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tape backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hour one of the thing they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotape okay if the videotape were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie wa awful simply awful the character are broadly drawn caricature that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the nature loving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliche were used to illustrate these caricature how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she s pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wear a lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy because he ha jagged teeth and talk like he s straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at it worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the character and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristic in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didn t work on top of being poorly developed most of the character were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had a miscarriage out in the wood and got medical attention at a hospital that look like it belongs in a bad slasher movie let s get on a plane home no i am having these bizarre nightmare and seeing strange vision and i want to find out what s going on ok frankly by the end of the movie i wa rooting for the witch i also felt that there wa simply too much blood n gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing u the horror the witch wa a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror wa all off screen and thus our imagination worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such nicety and went straight for the gross out this wa evident from the opening scene of the mad doctor forcing white goo down jeffrey s throat and continued throughout the film a the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort knife plunge into flesh bloody finger trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it wa too late for me to care this movie didn t stop with showing u the gore either it went for broke and showed u everything by the end of the movie there are no question remaining about the missing five hour it is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail i confess to being someone who prefers horror movie in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpse mere suggestion of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying i have seen interview with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil wa perpetrated only by the human mind i found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it wa in fact the director s intent then he need to have some word with the writer because it wa not made clear at all i know a lot of people who like to go to party and get drunk and stoned out of their mind none of them ha ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucination with a group of other people for the next week or so and if there wa no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch book of shadow wa a horrible movie from the poorly written character to the implausible story to the plot inconsistency to the gross out shot it wa a bad effort through and through

Sentence: all right all right we get the point despite all similarity to the best selling story speechless is not based on the romance between presidential campaign rival james carville and mary matalin in fact the script wa in development well before still the comparison are inevitable until one realizes a critical difference no it s not that the speechless twosome are speech writer not campaign manager it s that carville and matalin s story is actually interesting speechless is a limp poorly structured would be romantic comedy speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign where kevin vallick michael keaton and julia mann geena davis meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite side of the campaign kevin is a sit com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate s speech while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate at first each one belief that the other ha an ulterior motive for the relationship but eventually they let down their guard and become closer but there are plent of obstacle in the way including julia s stud reporter fiance christopher reeve and a series of stunt which continue to prove that all s fair in love and politics the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principle starting out a antagonist and realizing only at the end that they re crazy about each other screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectation by throwing kevin and julia into each other s arm in the first fifteen minute then developing the antagonism it s a noble attempt to shake thing up but unfortunately it just doesn t work part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy come from recognizing the chemistry even before the character do but in speechless they already know they re attracted to each other and we re left with waiting for the campaign to end so they ll admit that they love each other already there is such a herky jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king s sharp dialogue can t prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performance of geena davis and michael keaton and with those performance most of their scene together the problem begin with their initial courtship which doe virtually nothing to establish julia s character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise as davis is radiantly beautiful and keaton is generally entertaining but these character are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit in a couple of scene like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain they actually achieve some measure of connection for the most part however they re just actor spouting line you keep waiting for a little spark and it never happens perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless s politics the setting seems perfect for a high energy battle of the sex with partisanship thrown into the mix but that s never the tone that underwood is going for he want a warm fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman s flute and wind musical score and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fade into the background it might a well have been a story about rival grocer and every single character is about a uninspired a he or she could possibly be i wa about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king s previous screenplay the dana carvey flop clean slate so i had some hope for speechless but while there is wit in the word this is a script which wa probably much better on paper on screen it s still paper thin

Sentence: well there go another one sadly this like other movie this year wasn t good this one being almost a bad a the omega code but not quite from the opening credit i had a good feeling this would be bad and well i guess i wa right with bad excuse for acting a horrible screenplay and straight out bad direction the bachelor is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn t work on any level accept that fact that rene zellwegar who doe give a good performance the two cameo by brooke shield and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best the movie is troubled from the start because chris o donnell is hugely miscast and give one of the worst performance to date here is the stupid plot chris o donnell play jimmie shelton a man who ha just broken up with his girlfriend he meet anne rene zellwegar they instantly hit it off and are together for three year jimmie decides that he want to bring their relationship a little bit up he really doesn t realize that anne think he want to marry her what he want i never did catch so he proposes in a really bad way and she shoot him down and is very mad he of course try to apologize but nothing seems to help any then his grandfather dy and he learns that he ha left jimmie million dollar a long a he marries before the next day at pm now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he love her or get married to someone else to get the money itself leading to an un funny and predictable ending that leaf a bad taste in our mouth ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest cliched silliest romantic comedy to date that ha no real big laugh even the supporting role of artie lange hal holbrook and ed anser aren t even good the plot wa a good idea but the script would have to have been written in less than five minute and by a five year old the choppy dialogue and bad directing don t help thing any even though chris o donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movie he doe not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming sweet and likable performance a usual and really wa the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen brooke shield showed up in a funny little performance a a big headed mogul who after a while became routine and old one really can t help but think that we have seen this stuff before it s not like this is an original idea and in the end everyone know what is going to happen due do it cliche and typicalness the bachelor work on no good level and in fact doesn t work at all ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible role and mariah carey can not act to save her soul and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career chris o donnell is not a bad an actor a casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal he seems held back and really doesn t get into his character much and after even the first minute get annoying and old artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and wa completely unfunny and un nerving why the filmmaker would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success and sometimes i don t agree with other critic on movie even from the trailer for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny part it based on the silent film seven chance which i am sure is very better than this mess even though some may think of this a a good date movie most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back besides being a terrible movie the bachelor is well a terrible movie it ha nothing worth recommending therefore i really can t recommend this movie i did not have a good time and i laughed only three time the running time of the movie is minute which is wayyyy over time and need to be shortened at least thirty minute part of it seems to go on forever and part of seem to not last enough time being one of the worst movie of the year we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedy and if they do they i give up on filmmaker

Sentence: my inner flag wa at half mast last year when nick at nite pulled dragnet rerun off the air sure i d seen them all at least once but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laugh from ultra serious jack webb when there wa nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fan still have the d i a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost a hilarious a the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laugh out of webb s rapid fire speech and straight faced seriousness think of the d i a what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he play exactly the same character here a no nonsense old fart who look with disdain at the younger generation and love to give long winded melodramatic speech on any topic in this election year i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie open in characteristic fashion a one recruit after another knock on webb s office door and enters he give each one a different series of cranky criticism before the credit come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much go without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minute of him chewing out his recruit for no reason i wa wondering if there would even be a plot i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rant but the d i give u more much more webb s mission is to make a man out of private owen the local screw up the captain give webb three day to convert owen into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panty and ship him out myself whether the lace panty part refers to webb or owen remains unanswered this of course give webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owen life a living hell for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasure of webb watching here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the word should at least partially convey what i m talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness i ve got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistake of yours you re gon na turn around and i ll be standing right there i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy line like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar where he order a tomato juice he meet a woman who coincidentally also order tomato juice but walk away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine d i webb march over to the table get up in her face and say just what kind of a dame do you think you are bogart he ain t the other d i get one of the few memorable non webb line when he confesses to the girl he s a damn good d i i guess i m just a little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb s way with woman which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene a webb find his way to the woman s place of employment a lingerie store and stand around looking incredibly flustered at the negligee on display you expect me to talk to you in he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bra the woman go off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen a little girl spot him in the store and demand what are you doing in here you re a man aren t you he doesn t reply but you know he s thinking in his head what an odd specie of human so small must be one of those child everyone s been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversion he s responsible for the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance it also continues the owen subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb force his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owen killed during one of their drill after two private hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owen wa that flea you killed a male or female owen reply a male sir webb yell to the platoon this ain t the one that such a scene along with the rest of the movie wa intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it wa all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marine not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldier in the movie with the exception of owen were played by actual marine someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did it make it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there s a scene in the movie where the guy are on their break time discussing something and one of them break into laughter webb burst in the room and shout what did i tell you about laughing to which the private reply sir only nine year old girl laugh sir and let me tell you i wa a happy a a nine year old girl while watching this movie

warning cloud loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screening and scrapped plan for a gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show wa originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studio heavy hitter it eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening wa an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrill or wit remarkable in it banality and brutally uninvolving the avenger is a catastrophic mess which immediately invite comparison to last year s case study in style over substance joel schumacher s much loathed batman robin indeed both film even feature appalling ridiculous sequence which find central character dressed up in fuzzy oversized costume uma thurman who take on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg wa the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audience something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can t be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture a they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actor painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make a much of an inroad a his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange day the duo look the part and admittedly the avenger is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic character a they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmaker chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma a our mr peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigue me but gwyneth paltrow who wa originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent if nothing else it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such a it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip a lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonist superior it sound far better than it play and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it s clearly evident that the picture ha been cut to shred the avenger wa never about gripping drama and our hero accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it s all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approach the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all look good this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig command attention adeptly drawing element both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are a handful of striking visual moment in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bee and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instance fail to stir interest or raise pulse rate by the time the film s climax had arrived my interest wa not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing wave and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bit of visual bravura were the shot assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the round in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it s everything that the avenger is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outing of the year too drearily awful to be savoured a gleefully bad too polished to overlook it deficiency there may be upcoming picture that are even more lifeless than the avenger but i sure hope not

Sentence: m i the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it try to be a spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just look like it s an extended commercial for dude who think they look cool in throwaway sunglass it is a film that prefers techie gadget to anything human the coolest thing about this movie wa all the hole it had in it story and the most trite thing about the movie wa the usage of dove throughout a peace symbol the film play a if it wa a wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequence the film wa dull for three quarter of it time filled with too many dead spot in it story to garner concern about it wooden character or the superficial romance that developed a for the action scene they might look good to those who are convert to violence in their film but their advertisement for sadistic response is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which make it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen m i open and close with fast paced action scene but it is hard to get past the part which just drag on in banal dialogue the film look a if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake wa the horrible music composed by han zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s supposedly momentous action scene and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series but it artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actor to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chase choreographed fight with midair flip and kung fu kick slo mo shot of two gun blazing and of fire explosion but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and look more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile a he try to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like a fish out of water in this one their romance didn t work not only wa it tepid and not sexy but it wasn t convincing the film open with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is it best bet for success we will be in three different location instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mention that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mention that every hero need a worthy villain which explains the film s mythic theme a we enter the world of comic book myth on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott doe so in a one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trust called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorist who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountain before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who wa posing a dimitri turn out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cia like clone he steal the package with the antidote peel off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed a dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorist carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victim the antidote at marked up price we already saw the gimmick of peeling mask used in face off and in the original mission impossible which a convoluted a plot a that film had it wa still a superior film to this sequel woo ha run this peeling mask routine into the ground a it is used so often in this film by both side so much so that it blur any ethical character difference between good guy or villain it make it seem a if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and make it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertip while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his bos anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglass hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agent to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a high gadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told a an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charge will be dropped hopkins then sign off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five second actually with the departure of hopkins it wa this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruit nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly run her audi sport car over the side of a mountain road he also fall for her when this wa only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend wa sean ambrose and that he still want to f ck her the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him a she lead them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he share with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way the terrorist who aim to rule the world are interested in owning percent in a biotech company and in getting stock option a they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billion on the stock ethan come to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan doe this rescue against all odds a he find a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorist and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it a the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescue her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kick boxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenade at the terrorist making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick s everyone s as if i wa only entertained by this i could have lived with it but this film wa so badly made that it wa like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slam dunk but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is a critic proof film and will in all probability do well in the box office a it wa made to appeal to all the demographic who find commercial venture like this one easy to buy into

Sentence: perhaps best remembered a the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with this is the fake news norm macdonald at time could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi offensive phrase in his raspy voice coated with a condescending attitude his shtick wa marked by crassness in this movie for example when his girlfriend say that she s kicking him out because he s been fired from different job over the last month he try to calm the situation by saying maybe you ll feel better after we have some dirty sex this kind of humor can only go so far but certainly can t go the distance in a full length feature dirty work is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friend who grow up only physically emotionally they ve never outgrown their pubescent year which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback although having no apparent real world skill the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people if the meter maid wa unjust in giving you a ticket then dump a bunch of unpopped kernel of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart mitch norm macdonald and sam artie lange need to come up with in a period of two week so that sam s dad jack warden can have a heart operation their idea is to start a revenge for hire business where they ll do your dirty work in the funniest scene and possibly the only funny scene of the movie they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot their presence is established but when a less than honorable real estate developer hire them and then renege on the payment the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge by default dirty work should treat u to some outrageous revenge plot but it delivers jerky boy level material except for the bit at the used car lot and possibly another episode that involves frat brother the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about a funny a a prank phone call already weak on material it further spiral itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he ha an unsatisfied libido and need broad and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase a a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction but what s really painfully evident is that norm macdonald ha no versatility a an actor relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying note to self note to self learn to fight he say after getting beat up note to self there s always beer he say after hitting rock bottom etc we feel like we re just watching an elongated rehash of his not so glorious day on saturday night live much like the television show for minute we get one or two funny bit the rest of the story is just dead space

Sentence: the most interesting part of can t hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of u the one part that many of u can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film s sole sarcastic member who mock everything that go on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and look totally bored the film wisely hold over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some member of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotype much of which i went to high school with everyone s here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominion of trekkies and x philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film show them a superficial lame and basically a a bunch of loser except for denise who roll her eye at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quote oscar wilde definite pointer there unfortunately the writer and director take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film a i said portrays most of it character a superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these character into our hero we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotype with only a shread of humanity and realism and try to tell boring and overly melodramatic tale about them a if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being here s a quick low down it s graduation and we follow a bunch of senior on the last night otherwise known a the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them a they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party can t hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who s been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he think they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his love for her in the hope he ll build up the gut to give it to her even though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what go on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because it s a party there are some more main character such a william charlie finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominion who ha come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who s humiliated him for year but get too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who ha decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately get stuck in a bathroom don t ask with kenny where the two character let down their character and are allowed to follow the law of plot cliche from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two film that embraced and ultimately made human out of many of it high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes film of the s most notably sixteen candle the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize it main character and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize it character and ultimately tell a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotype and then say that it s all okay we can t take this film seriously nor can we take this a fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some thing i did like i liked the direction except for a couple too over the top feature like way too glossy jump cut it s like an oxymoron and other obscurity generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio day his desintegration of his wigger character wa almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful a denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn t work with the film when really thought about she s far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically give everything a delightfully satirical tone she s not just the cynic or the intellectual she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damage other already damaged character she may ruin the film more but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained a couple other thing that just don t work mike s character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end act a though he ha forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all jenna eflman s uncredited cameo a an angel just didn t work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason i m giving this such a low rating is because it refuse to give u any fully realized character and then insists we follow around complete stereotype from other movie doing thing that are inane and unlike anything we d do we don t feel for these character because for most of u we aren t stereotype going through the motion to worn subplots the acid test for high school movie is doe it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though

Sentence: godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who care about plot summer movie a loose remake of the classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monster which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlin s big budget lizard stomp manhattan disaster flick ha been written with the brain dead in mind the script isn t just dumbed down it s lobotomized godzilla life and dy on special effect alone presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boy the demographic most likely to shell out repeatedly to see the same image of monster instigated carnage that s not to say that female and other age group are immune to the special effect seduction they re just not a readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actor stargate wa a financial success independence day wa a runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie in before it even open it s virtually guaranteed at least million nice number for a film that could have been penned by a not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn t completely without merit although it is close there s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wear off quickly frankly while the special effect are competent they re not all that stunning there s nothing new here it s jurassic park meet alien with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star war movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level godzilla never really push the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone the imagination of monster movie like king kong ha been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla ha been chosen to close the st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isn t even exciting with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn t a sequence in this film that raise the pulse even the scene with dozen of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but it wa full of adrenaline moment capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of it production a in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin human trying to stop him the plot such a it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking a few ship and leaving some footprint on tropical island godzilla show up in the big apple he doe some of the usual tourist thing stop by garden visit the chrysler building go on a walk through central park and take the subway in the process he knock over a few building and step on countless cab but he never ha trouble with traffic jam on hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who ha a theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportion a a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb test in the south pacific in nick s word godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of it kind a luck would have it nick s old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around a he trail godzilla then just when the military ha rejected nick s theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruit him for a special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla ha chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan ha been destroyed so many time in recent disaster movie independence day deep impact armageddon that it s becoming boring the whole tradition of monster roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape wa only about foot tall he could climb the empire state building at ten time that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains a few lame attempt at humor there s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that play like sit com material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick s last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critic roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personality have alter ego in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager ebert s re election slogan is not surprisingly thumb up for new york the siskel ebert stuff is amusing the first time it s used but after a while it grows tiresome and although the character don t serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesn t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard that s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren t capable of good performance both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they aren t a list name then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god play the love interest and hank azaria great expectation is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesn t really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar ha assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion picture is pretty much critic proof it may also be word of mouth proof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friend say so when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movie of all time it s like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionist waving their wand and mesmerizing audience with their smoke and mirror it s probably too much to hope that some day movie goer will wake up and realize that they ve been had

Sentence: in the continuation of warner brother s franchise joel schumacher ha successfully killed this cash cow what make this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project a the client is such a shock that it give rise to thought that the latter film wa a fluke situation are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the character from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl who just happens to be alfred s niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue a an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he ha become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escape me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she want to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she join with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creation no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the character have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier film now that he ha an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homily about family and relationship while at the same time not really having any george clooney try in vain to keep from rolling his eye while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performance are still on e r bruce wayne ha the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce s latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion a there wa for nicole kidman s psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin come off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he s just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smack of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris o donnell once considered a rising star successfully burn up on reentry with this performance his robin need nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better this talented young actress read her line with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she wa cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings u to the villain arnold scharzenegger walk through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze s imprisonment the guard are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fight scene caught on film it s almost a ludicrous a seeing michael jackson a a gang member umu thurman strut and coo her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy ha all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performance worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veteran carry their scene with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacy of the plot there is one question that always come to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villain manage to hire so many thug only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlum that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor one have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brother ha succeeded in retrograding the series back to it s tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scene are the superimposed title detailing the pow gwaaaa s and clang s associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalty from this film the special effect by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary star of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy s lair the batcave to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for year to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effect have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effect have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scene are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher ha directed the film with no flair camera angle are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shot pepper the action scene destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just ha to look back on the film the lost boy cousin an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin come off a a mated made for tv movie the film ha no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even

that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writer the movie start off with a bang a howler of an opening credit sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphic and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick down a one armed detective and hammer s best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chamber paul sorvino he is immediately on the killer s trail here the movie

sex clinic many of the same character from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different role for instance charles kalecki alan king a number runner and narcotic dealer in the book turn into a suave mob bos and more importantly hammer s suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic i the jury is one of several cinematic rendition of spillane s book including a version which wa made in d but this film differs from those earlier version in one major way it includes all

not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward woman it feature one woman having her neck slashed a set of twin forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillane s writing ha a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment it constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it s no surprise that the movie like the book fade to black with a dead woman on the floor i the jury had a troubled production and wa not well supported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theater and many people have forgotten that it wa ever made the script wa written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movie like it s alive and it two sequel q and the stuff cohen wrote the script thinking he wa going to helm the project a well but he wa yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he wa already over budget he wa quickly replaced by richard t heffron who ha worked for the last three decade on a handful of undistinguished movie and dozen of television project heffron wa obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it show in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron ha none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scene ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie feature numerous car chase shoot out and stunt but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity i the jury take on the air of a made for tv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problem in i the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character wa lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifty to the eighty because spillane wrote all his hammer mystery in the first person hammer s character is central to the tale because all the event are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no first person voice over narration and some scene don t have hammer in them at all consequently a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost the period updating turn out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization a a hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself i the jury refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law unlike private eye who seek out the bad guy and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen a above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer come off not only a amoral in society s term but in any term especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie doe away with that in the first three minute by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife wa being unfaithful maybe the scene wa intended for laugh but it only cheapens hammer s character and is by all account a lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulder because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling he delivers a fine performance spillane never once described hammer s physical attribute in any of the dozen book in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillane s book will have a strong personal notion of what hammer look like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectation spillane who played the character himself in s the girl hunter is generally considered the best of the film hammer the rest of actor are most un noteworthy with the exception of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were up and comer who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mid eighty which only add to the made for tv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right element together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it

Sentence: synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escape certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who like to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenge the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rock and giving birth without a mate comment allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movie she proved quite charming a the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy a pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly try to capitalize on hannah a a selling point the poster art bear a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently feature her name in lettering the same size a the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it s so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually try and miserably fails to be serious that it s oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaf the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud play out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read a a child with all the so called dirty part blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope it s time better than it film adaptation if not then i m at a complete loss to explain it popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately open with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramp about in the wood with her cute little ponytail and fur wrapped about her the audience s expectation of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallow up ayla s mother a blonde with fur pant er legging tearful ayla look on a the cameraman shake the camera well a the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i won t detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even give the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about a subtle a burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn t just suggest this message it whack the message into the audience with a two by four a blond gorgeous woman challenge the social law of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wig she s of the new people they re of the old people with the memory yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprise me the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing a stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she look like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the character have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from it new age trapping maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sound dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film s faux mysticism including spirit animal and dream vision and a narrator who sound like a psychic you d expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that ha serious problem being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive film i ve seen in quite a while it contains several scene of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scene the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempt to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bite his head off and the audience see it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous i m sure it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however a i wrote at the beginning of this review it doe have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottom of the barrel film dealing with early man fantasy movie involving dinosaur who did not exist at the same time a man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear try so hard to be serious that though it s so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and character of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two star i have to think that fan of the book would be disappointed with this film version however i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise

Sentence: if anything stigma should be taken a a warning against releasing similarly themed film relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flick released this year it is clearly the worst i suppose i should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense wa mildly spooky and then stir of echo had it moment but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer ha slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigma is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while no not really patricia arquette play frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary a a gift from her globe trotting mother a it turn out the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who ha made a career out of disproving supposed religious sign but this time he belief there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie start exhibiting sign of the stigma in which a person is inflicted with wound like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering she s an atheist but once he witness the stigma attack himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begin to suspect that his bos cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church a it turn out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video i mean film stigma is the sort of film that start off ok and only get worse indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because it s only interesting for about five minute i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he ha the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he ha been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such a it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what i can do i m an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scene with slow motion shot of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shot a that of an egg frying ooh scary if there wa some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didn t see it just when you thought it wa safe to get involved in the story here come a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if stigma had a story or character that were remotely engaging though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help he doe seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren t given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she s kind of cute so let s start the bleeding the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wound on your wrist and back go clubbing sure that make sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their character are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scene between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reach the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eye she still find the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advance father andrew s religious doubt pop up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic a for pryce he may a well wear a curled mustache and cackle i ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turn out to be a villain what s worse after being faced with dull character and the prospect of having annoying camera trick and loud music jammed down our throat we now have to contend with a story that start off in one direction veers off in another then another and end up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot detail how doe frankie get the stigma merely by touching a rosary how come an atheist like her wa chosen since father andrew mention that only very devout believer have ever received stigma actually i m not sure what frankie wa posessed by supposedly stigma occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later ha her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effect and flashy camera work mr wainwright want to use this time furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmaker compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church a the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there s nothing the catholic need to worry about though stigma s religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priest a mobster they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suit and tommy gun which would have been far more interesting i m not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but it cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any mean it s rare to see a film that fails on a many level a stigma doe it s not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretend to be i m not sure why they tried to pas this off a a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scene have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many film of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigma that it eventually ha no effect on the audience leaving u to pick out the film s many flaw i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sound like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which mean that for all it flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog day of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigma is it

Sentence: john boorman s zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it take on a bizarre enjoyment quality all it own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr ha a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood s career can be explained by two thing he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand can not court such excuse to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn t know it from this film boorman doe indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance a well a the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest his film all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that come at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he s ambitious and when he succeeds it s in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman fall the resounding impact can be heard for mile around zardoz is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystical movie an obsession of boorman s his screenplay try to elicit the same mythological connotation of the arthurian legend or even the wizard of oz a book which figure into the movie s plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the event take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact thing seems to have moved backwards with people riding horse shooting old style gun and living in large victorian mansion it s more middle age than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemisphere the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectual live in comfort and everlasting life these immortal never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological power and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one break the rule that person is punished by being aged so many year if someone break the rule enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminal one of the immortal arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the resident to farm so the immortal can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head this flying head is one of the movie s opening image and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gather a bunch of outlander and make them into a group called the exterminator whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlander so they can t procreate and take up more resource from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellow seriously laugh inducting statement like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie s cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneak into zardoz s flying stone push frayn out and go back to the vortex once there the immortal label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientist show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what get him worked up i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of face although i have a hard time believing that a production moved forward he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it wa becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggle he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and a pair of thigh high patent leather boot that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both side of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in and perhaps he wa looking for a change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it s a wonder it didn t end his career i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statement is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinction and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it a an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substance are the only one i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness a anything more than a completely unintentional comedy
