lost ideal of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feeling of despair and nihilism found it reflection in many film of that era martin scorsese s taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventy is most celebrated of them all the movie s protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who take the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can t sleep at night the job get him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis

interpretation for some critic and scholar it is an exploration of universal subject that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial city the story could have been set in century same a in our time for others the movie us raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problem of america it apparent inability to deal with the consequence of rapid social change that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give argument for both side his travis bickle ha a lot in common with most of the average viewer of today many of u share his feeling of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drug prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempt to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstance like with secret service agent pimp or job interviewer make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewer are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizen or troubled soul from fanatical madman but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheer for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person want but doesn t have a stomach lack of brain to do it while de niro s travis might come in and out of particular time and place other person that appear in the film mostly played by the character actor give it distinctively feel wizzard played by peter boyle present the only link with america s better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he know stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled

porno movie that should be the element of new time of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politician like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless message that cover the lack of any serious program can t fool even such idiot like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can t be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese us the best of his cinematic skill in order to spill the gloom of schrader s screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed a a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewer give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz element give some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest irony of taxi driver is the fact that the movie wa same a his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merit for many year it wa tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of event in the movie now more than two decade later when some other life imitating art incident get more attention we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all it artistic glory

Sentence: warren beatty s bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesn t attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that ha infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many way it is however a loud and raucous a it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and co wrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sister star a incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who ha one of the best politician name in cinema history bulworth is a democrat and in beatty s view he is symbolic of everything that ha gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth ha long since succumbed to the materialistic pressure of washington instead of waging the battle for the impoverished and the downtrodden which wa once the calling card of democrat bulworth ha become another sell out money hound if he s not accepting illegal bribe from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contribution from the chinese he s making wind bag speech that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium blah blah blah when the film open it is a few day before the primary election and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he ha become in a fit of desperation he take out a million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hire a hit man to kill him although he doesn t know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truth about the state of american politics and the society in general at a compton church he tell the group of african american that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wing and get behind somebody other than a running back who stab his wife later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mix with the hollywood elite then insult the quality of their movie and informs them that the only reason he s there is because my guy always put the big jew on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworth s chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment platt ha some of the movie s funniest scene a he make murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant half truth telling and spin doctoring to cover bulworth s stampede is equaled in it perversion only by a self righteous reporter nora dunn who act like murphy s refusal to explain bulworth s action something he really can not do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he want to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grim looking assassin to be who s trailing him at every turn he hide out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wear to one of his television interview at this point beatty abandon much of the political aspect and dive into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner city experience bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meet at the harlem church rally she ha a tough talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d don cheadle of boogie night who also becomes involved in bulworth s campaign some of the scene in the ghetto ring true but much of it feel like a lighter version of scene depicted in more intense inner city film like boyz n hood and menace ii society bulworth s chief liability is beatty s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap a his new communication device instead of speaking at political rally he break into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip hop star are black it s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether he s actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sound more run d m c than snoop doggy dogg which make the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner city lingo and working that into his speech instead of trying to sound like l l cool j other than that bulworth hit all it target with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you don t agree with beatty s liberal message about the unrequited duty of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film ha in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary color which opened earlier this year bulworth doesn t try to tip toe around the truly painful issue that hit close to home instead it take them dead on

Sentence: i know what you did last summer the first high profile slasher thriller to be released after s scream and written by the same screenwriter kevin williamson is a stylish effective horror film that became s biggest hit of the fall season while scream wa a more knowing film about the genre i know what you did last summer is more reminiscent of a straight forward slasher flick but it is far more intelligent than such bottom of the barrel guilty pleasure a all nine of the friday the film well okay jason go to hell wa pure hell to sit through the film start off with four talented aspiring teenage friend who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport n c it is the of july and they will soon be heading their separate way kind hearted julie jennifer love hewitt and outsider ray freddie prinze jr will be headed off to college while helen sarah michelle gellar who ha just been honored croaker queen in the town and her ignorant jock boyfriend barry ryan phillippe are going to new york to become an actress and football player when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain side beach for the evening they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home distraught and confused they decide they can t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean in hope no one will find him julie is apprehensive about it but is forced into it by barry switch to exactly a year later still unable to come to term with what she did reluctantly return home from college to find that all three of her old friend are still in the town because their career plan did not work out almost immediately julie recieves an ominous letter that simply read i know what you did last summer and that is the start of their problem a they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook i know what you did last summer is a successful horror film for a number of reason the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described a hitchcockian a it put shadow fog steam and other clever device to add atmosphere to the proceeding the character particularly julie and helen are realistically written and the film amazingly deal with their broken relationship in a few scene which is largely uncharacteristic in film of this sort and last the film creates a few dazzling and scary set piece that are some of the most memorable i ve seen in a horror movie particularly the suspenseful superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family s store with the killer inside with her perhaps the best character is that of missy egan anne heche a lonely backwoods woman whose brother wa the one julie think they hit heche s performance is a standout a she is able to create a full character in only about ten minute of screen time i know what you did last summer could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problem prinze jr give a performance to be desired here and much of his dialogue sound wooden coming out of his mouth also the climax of the film almost completely loses it frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any line luckily the penultimate scene save the disappointing finale which includes an expertly crafted jump in your seat scare in the main role hewitt and gellar are highly talented and hewitt especially is one of the best screamer i ve ever heard she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best scream queen and gellar is touching a a young woman who in the course of one year find her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered although not up to the level of either scream movie or the more recent urban legend i know what you did last summer is a respectable smartly scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movie were once again being made

Sentence: airplane is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film making after all it s brought to u by one of the best known satire writing directing team even if most people don t recognize the name behind the film they are bound to recognize the title airplane top secret the naked gun and hot shot to name a few but although the zucker abraham zucker team wa first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in airplane remains the true cornerstone of their work and their directorial debut in the seventy disaster film seemed to be at an all time high film like earthquake the towering inferno and the poseidon adventure were big hit there wa also a series about the disaster that can arise when traveling by plane a series that spanned the entire decade and so in we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean it had to do with bad fish airplane is the story of ted striker robert hay an ex fighter pilot who ha never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six er seven comrade unable to stop living in the past ted s world fell apart he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job and eventually a we begin this film is getting dumped by his lover flight attendant elaine dickinson julie hagerty in a desperate attempt not to lose her ted buy a ticket for the same flight elaine is working unfortunately she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her which leaf him wallowing in self pity in the midst of it all something happens someone get sick then another then another soon the whole plane is full of deathly ill chicago bound people and when the pilot get sick played by peter graf kareem abdul jabbar and frank ashmore who will save the day gee i wonder of course the main draw here is the non stop whiz bang comedy with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gag although i had seen this movie a few time before i wa still laughing thru the entire thing the most fun character by far is the doctor played by leslie nielsen he s a dry subtle sterotypically straight faced doctor that end up saying some of the funniest line of the film in a film like this you re not really expecting an elaborate production so one can t complain about the amateurish quality what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny played by stephen stucker this character is pointless nauseating and very unfunny i don t know why he wa put in there and i don t think anybody will find a good excuse and when the film nears an end it slows down quite a bit almost getting old you got ta give it to a movie that only run minute and can feel two hour long aside from that airplane is really a top notch spoof that will likely forever be known a a spoof classic it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friend especially if they haven t seen it and if they ask what the plot is just tell em it s a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film but that s not important right now if you ve seen the film you ll understand

Sentence: let me open this one with a confession i love cop movie i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i wa actually one of the first in line to see s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brother steven wa it any good well just about a good a baldwin s steven seagal impression for those i ve confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i don t love just any cop movie i m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flick that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker i m partial to those gritty earthy cop drama like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these film come along just about a often a george w bush make a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie doe hit multiplex i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movie that transform me into a moron willing to shell out for a movie called one tough cop which actually sound a lot like a wiseguy spin off no truth is i m a sucker for those barren street that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminal lurk and cop like modern day knight must shield u from their iniquitous clutch yes it s all very corny and awfully boy clubish which i m guessing is precisely where these feeling come from a little tot u boy are brought up to create our own war with gi joe s enact cop and robber or cowboy and indian fantasy etc the best gritty cop film tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasy and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral line and psychological chaos a an adult my taste haven t changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexity of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if it s the cop who re the corrupt one ooh that one really get me going these protector using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shift from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a sub genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film star treat williams who give the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i wa hatched a mere two year prior to the release of prince of the city i can not provide an answer a to why it didn t though judging from his recent role in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably ha something to do with quite a few bad career move like mickey rourke and eric robert both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didn t make it to where he should have if there wa any justice in this dog gone world keanu reef would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino s in serpico also directed by lumet williams play danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officer who take down drug dealer on the gritty pre juliani street of new york they work without uniform or hour much like paid vigilante and that analogy is more than apt seeing a how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt mean to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informant low level junky to gain access to the big wig and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junky with the junk of their choice danny ha done this and though he s a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intention have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seek redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affair who then convince him to go undercover a a double agent he doe so with one condition he will not rat on his partner right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop film are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliche like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issue of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city take all this and charge it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet a well a a handful of intense performance most notably by treat lumet s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lay back and let the camera soak up the action his scene transition rapidly from one to the next building layer of tension and he rarely hold for reaction shot instead he click away at precisely the moment a character stop yakking lumet s worst tendency is one that many film maker especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actor shouting their line at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isn t a much a problem here a it wa in night fall on manhattan lumet s most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet ha made several really awful career choice maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he wa on sustaining tension in a film that run for minute with not one dull spot some of the formula picture i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kind of picture even tolerable of course cop movie aren t popular anymore yes buddy cop flick are popular but those are more like extended sitcom with gunfire amid the punch line but just look at the average hollywood action movie flick so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serf no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn t gay the lame comic relief character who s never funny and on and on for all it moral ambiguity prince of the city is a back to the basic cop courtroom drama that leaf out all the crap and really thrill it focus completely on it story and it character all of whom are completely believable from the cop to the lawyer to the junky there s a great scene early on where an irate williams shout at an ia officer and look a if he s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speech but instead he break down in front of the cop and begin sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifice his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that make him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the word out he s lost his voice doe that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little thing

Sentence: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff two girl and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girl carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue embracing a near real time approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hang upon the performance of it three actor and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering character fortunately the film s cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchange between the triad of character while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the film s setup is fairly generic in nature and open rather unpromisingly we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft a they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriend to return from the airport and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation it s when blake return to his abode where the film hit it stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that burst onto the scene and raise the stake to new height it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the film s best choice wa to have his two girlfriend scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing u to size up blake not with his interaction with others but by his own innate behaviour whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving message to his beloved carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the spark begin to fly one of the great touch in the film is how blake when startled by carla s unannounced appearance begin to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag double teamed by the understandably aggrieved woman who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declaration against their verbal jab surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by it trio of character two girl and a guy concludes it first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing wa off limit for this film however it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length and it s a the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundity on the nature of fidelity and relationship that it slowly but surely begin to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film s tempo loses it liveliness the dynamic between the character evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequence fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusion are made a poster of jules et jim hang prominently on the wall and secret are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girl and a guy wa embroiled in a bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regard to this scene contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film mr toback wa forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down version of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girl and a guy serf a a showcase for the phenomenal talent of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he play the gamut from indignant to humbled from self assured to disconcerted yet his acting gear shift so smoothly a to not be registered it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four day shortly after mr downey jr wa arrested on drug charge and it s hard not to see echo of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blake s self chiding to get his shit together is disquieting in it resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actress are solid in more broadly observed role m graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actress involving herself in three successive risky project two girl and a guy and boogie night are both quite sexually frank while lost in space ha a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman she s quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile m gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audience are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tone it down substantially a the film progress but i found her more fun to watch a the artificially excitable chatterbox the film wa reportedly shot in eleven day filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifact of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girl and a guy ha an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one sens that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actor while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesn t feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his character in an effective manner two girl and a guy fall short of it potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr it s still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly a we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the table on his girlfriend i m an actor he tell them at one point using the ol tried and tested occupational hazard defense actor lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington

Sentence: if there is one thing that bother me about hollywood film it s their predictable ending the devil s advocate ha the atypical hollywood ending when everything that should happen doe unfortunately for the devil s advocate this ending nearly collapse in on itself and ruin the entire film nevertheless the film doe provide two and a half hour of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever wa in charge of the preview for this film i don t think i wa quite prepared for this movie because the trailer made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it doe contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ad is the other plot element and seemingly more interesting one at that the devil s advocate begin in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reef is the defense attorney working for a client whom ha been accused of raping a young girl he end up with a not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaf the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he fly to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting jury and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john al pacino asks him to work permanently a a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost a a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begin to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begin to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann take up a friendship with a neighbor who always give advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hour upon hour with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while thing turn completely upside down a kevin s wife claim to have seen monstrous image superimposed on her friend a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin s real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john really satan playing trick with kevin s life the devil s advocate play out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriter wanted to surprise everyone by giving u something we don t expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make u feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devil s advocate mess up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending a is now than i would have if it had ended ten minute early i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i wa settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what wa the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didn t like the ending the producer of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just a it is ending they pull the rug out from under you film like and the usual suspect can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devil s advocate on the other hand end unpredictably not from u knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again a for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hour being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film run like a well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which doe not occur it wa at this point that i felt cheated taking u on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around a he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which make most of the film seem like a game i don t want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned it r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn t subtle about anything showing u everything it actually surprise me that this film did not receive an nc rating a it is quite harsh however the movie doe have it merit and nudity and sex are among those i don t condone sex and nudity in film but if it there i might a well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontation between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stand out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann s problem are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reason other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually ha something to say about humanity in one of the last scene john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god play with his child he is satan of course he comment that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god set up rule which contradict human nature this semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton say is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it wa funny but patially realizing it wa true these moral dilemma are present throughout the devil s advocate giving it an added depth many film skip over in their writing but i m sure they came straight from the novel it wa based on when a film ha something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlight a we see memorable face and they put spin on those memorable face we don t expect heather matarazzo make a brief appearance a the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she doe a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reef he ha proven himself an uneven actor success such a speed and bomb such a johnny mnemonic but he top himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witch of eastwick and max von sydow needful thing he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scene but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known a the principal in ferris bueller s day off also give a good performance a eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance a the mother who hold a secret to kevin s past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several time one familiar face with a twist wa coach star craig t nelson who give a very good performance the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minute this film move along fairly quickly for the first two hour i sat completely engaged in the good performance and strong character the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effect and a good musical score director taylor hackford ha managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minute i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minute early

Sentence: one of the more unusual and suggestively violent film ever made is just a few step away from brilliance however those few step away are only a few step from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discus the film received mixed review upon release but there s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critic perhaps did not notice at time it get preachy about the horror it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent the shocking conclusion is just a unpredictable a the ending of most film are predictable this piece of work is intensity it s uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i can not turn away the story creep along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he ha experience in tantalizing his audience with information and vision but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien is even more ominous because the threat is real it s human and while the script take some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer work here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credit i ve ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development take place morgan freeman star a detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt co star a detective david mill the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guy these two fine actor give the film it human quality along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who play tracy mill wife however none of them stand out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actor could have played these part and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset ha only a week or that s seven day left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sin a chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sin in order of how each victim wa found it s the last two sin that are the most intriguing and shocking but i won t give that away a i said this ha a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer set out to make a statement to the world that these sin will no longer be tolerated and he make the sinner suffer for it the two partner stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he wa murdered forced to eat himself to death the killer leaf small clue at this and other murder and of course somerset and mill are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didn t it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but it s not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown like most of the violence in pulp fiction is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is post death still if you tend to get queasy don t eat food during this film kevin spacey play john doe the avenging angel who claim that he s the messenger who will right the wrong with his teaching like many crazy men he ha some fine idea but some sick way of expressing himself spacey doesn t appear until the final minute and also doesn t receive billing in the opening credit however it s his appearance that turn this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that it s hard to disagree when he say that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer ha ever been so creative is blatantly unsubtle with it message about the horror of the world and it s often a little too depressing what it lack in those area it make up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twist and realistic character the technical aspect of the film are unobtrusive fincher us lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we don t find out what happens to mill and somerset after the closing credit which are run backwards up the screen it s better to imagine what path they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget it s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing the evil of the world aren t going to cure themselves raise some tough question and it s intelligent enough to allow it audience to answer many of those question for themselves useless trivia co star in s brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best supporting actor oscar pitt in monkey spacey in the

Sentence: it s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x doe it and for that i commend it it not only take ball but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their life to hating anyone who s not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pull it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind follower that make up most skinhead member since he is the leader of the pack he s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that make eerie sense when he speaks he s so utterly convincing a a public speaker and so firm in his conviction that it come a a shock when he actually go through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he s almost a convincing and arresting a public speaker a say malcom x when we first see him he s clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and he s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxer and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullet at least when he doesn t need them he so belief in his conviction that he s willing to put his belief to the test even if he know it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple year american history x is about derek how he became a neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he wa rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that wa less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stage a a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who try to correct what he s done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all side or at least that s the intention the film s framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brook who i just found out wa or is the captain on star trek s deep space is trying to correct him when the film open danny ha just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which cause him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it ha gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he s cleaned up not a buff and ha a full head of hair he s just a intelligent but still very rough along the edge but he s wisened up he s no longer controlled by his anger at black and jew and try to persuade danny who s becoming what derek wa before to give up his lifestyle but danny won t he go to a large skinhead beer bash meet with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is a opposed to neo nazi dom a he wa for it a couple of year ago the film circle around this then spin off into non linear flashback all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime a a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raid on local store that no longer hire the white middle class teenager since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrant to do the same work and mouthing off his theory on affirmative action and how illegal immigrant and black have destroyed the fundamental this country wa built on to them the white man is the one who ha gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he back everything up with political reason justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he say sound true american history x is a collection of really great scene and moment rather than a cohesive great film that flow effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scene i ve seen all year one scene feature a dinner between derek s family and his mother s newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek s rightist view launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that build unparalled emotion in the audience gould s reaction to derek s final summation is unnerrving another scene us humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co worker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soon to be classic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that wind derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there s much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with stand out coming from avery brook beverly d angelo a the long suffering mother and gould who ha one horrible line but other than that come off with the best performance he s given in what seems like a really long time norton walk off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton ha invented himself a one of the most reliable and intense actor of his generation and maybe the best there s nothing like it when norton really get rolling in this movie spewing out line with such authority that he command all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allows the little emotion to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isn t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hope to be it s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off a either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movie tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinhead are reduced to mere cliche kevin smith regular ethan suplee fair rather annoyingly a the fat skinhead whose line consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isn t a well travelled furlong s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashback refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which wa inevitable it doesn t seem like it ha actually arrived there even derek s descent into skinhead dom doesn t seem justified though his fireman father william rus the dad from boy meet world and don t ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his belief a such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history x is a very good movie and i wa very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut a it is is not up to what he claim to be his potential somewhere he claim there lie a tony kaye cut and that wa to be the true cut until it wa viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by it director it wasn t allowed to him under the ground that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really that s the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kaye s right in that it s not up to par even if he s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be a do the right thing for the late yet it still get it point across intelligently and back it up with it story it message that one can not be so enwrapped in one s own belief or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isn t perfect at least when avery brook turn to norton after he ha been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he s done ha made his life any better it realy hit a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience

Sentence: scream like it predecessor is a genre crossing film it is about horror film and murder mystery the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time scream wa also known for it self referential tone many inside joke were made in reference to horror movie and wes craven again scream follows suit with character saying such thing a sequel suck and the entire horror genre wa destroyed by sequel scream s story is very similar to it s predecessor s sidney neve campbell having survived the killing spree in scream is now in college gale weather courteney cox ha written a book about the murder and that book is now being released a a feature film called stab which for all practical purpose is the real world movie scream at the premiere of stab two student from sidney s college are stabbed to death and a new story begin the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer they want to know all about the link between stab sidney and the recent murder the most complex self reference i saw this should be an olympic event wa the scene where gale weather wa asking question at a press conference the rest of the press wa watching and videotaping weather the other survivor from scream were watching and videotaping the press the audience wa watching the whole filmed scene whew the movie is packed with layer and self reference that make it a pleasure to watch even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream that s not to say that these reference necessarily make scream a deep or even a good movie the just add to the fun of watching it i recommend it for other reason a well what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible it is a person in a mask and a robe his only advantage the fear he strike into his victim no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movie you have less ground to say it s just a movie the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself gale weather and deputy dewey david arquette also from the original track down a killer they are likeable but not outstanding but in combination with the horror aspect the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint it wa exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream the internet movie database say that scream is in the work so i wonder if i ll be doing the same thing on january if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high i ll be happy to mark my calendar

Sentence: uncompromising french director robert bresson s lancelot of the lake achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory s morte darthur instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knight of the round table it dethrones them by revealing arthur a a weak ineffectual leader and the knight a a group of jealous bickering men who failed to live up to the legend prescribed to them chivalry ha no place in lancelot of the lake except a that of a dying ideal bresson begin his tale a the knight of the round table are returning decimated after failing merlin s command to retrieve the holy grail the mystical cup that wa filled with christ s blood bresson immediately give u his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest bloodshed and failure the opening sequence is a series of clumsy disjointed fight amongst anonymous knight a head is hacked off a stomach is impaled a skull is split open skeletal remains hang from tree and burning body smolder in the ruin of a flaming house since the film start with camelot in near ruin and take only an hour and a half to arrive at it inevitable conclusion it doesn t carry the grand tragic resonance of other arthurian film we never get to see camelot at the peak of it power therefore there is no real downfall to witness but then again it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film rather it is lancelot and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart than the external downfall of a kingdom lancelot ha always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tale and bresson us him a the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh the greatest of all knight he wa flawed only in his love for arthur s wife queen guinevere and it wa that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot even when lancelot attempt to end the affair with guinevere laura duke condominas he only find himself falling back into her arm against his better judgment he know it mean the destruction of the idealized kingdom but he is powerless in his passion when sir mordred patrick bernhard accuses lancelot of the affair other knight including sir gawain humbert balsan spring to lancelot s defense it is this battle within the knight that is the eventual undoing of the round table the flesh win out over the spirit and the consequence are dire bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interior of men s heart and mind lancelot of the lake is filled with his particular trademark a stripped down minimalist style flat expressionless dialogue and a grand use of natural sound in place of music he us background music only twice in the film during an opening narration segment and during the opening credit the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipe but the rest of the film is scored with natural sound that punctuate the film s thematic element the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor the neighing of horse the rhythm of hoof beating down dirt road and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest like most of his other film bresson employed nonprofessional actor who recite the dialogue in emotionless flat voice all the actor he used in lancelot of the lake had never acted before and with the exception of patrick bernhard they never acted again never once do they raise their voice or put any emphasis on a given word instead of using vocal inflection bresson strove to create emotion through image in some way this technique work in other way it doesn t the final montage of arthur s men battling each other is quite marvelous and the final image of the knight in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap pile sum up the entire film in one moment however other time bresson s uncompromising method are distracting and questionable for instance during an important jousting contest bresson film the majority of the action so that the only thing visible are the horse leg he doe this repeatedly opening each shot with the same few note from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag while there might be symbolic value in this the resulting experience of watching it can be bothersome nevertheless lancelot of the lake is a fascinating cinematic experience boldly made by a master filmmaker bresson s style may not be for everyone but one ha to respect his strength a an artist by re evaluating the arthurian legend and making them his own he turn lancelot of the lake into something rare in modern cinema a truly personal film

them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoiler follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the file is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effect unlike other summer movie the effect do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performance this is coming from a guy who think david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie doe not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movie the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our hero in fact the first time the critter in this movie make an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might a well bring ear plug because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much wa when i first saw alien a a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your foot on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x file is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination work overtime and it sure beat having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it look like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the file is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minute total no the file is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson get maybe half the screen time she ha a couple of good scene with duchovny but she get kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she doe not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder shower independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent event mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who care if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our hero so we feel a if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i can not stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movie the dialogue is twice a important a the effect miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movie you will go home and tell all your friend how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movie don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scene because again unlike most summer movie godzilla anybody the file doe not need to fill scene between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serf a purpose who need to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attack so far this summer i have seen only one movie who rank higher on my list of movie i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only win by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x file is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effect it s got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fan of the series will hate this movie while non fan will have a good time it doe not provide answer to the show s many question the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five star for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrill many whoah i never saw that one coming moment four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five star so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the track it leaf in the snow behind him go on for several mile but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s maker drove the truck for several mile to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it look like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving

with all wonderful dream sequence and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss there s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say on further examination i wasn t sure exactly what it wa if you meet jesus at the bowling alley it s not going to be what you expect when the going get weird the weird go bowling maybe there s no real message perhaps it s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world maybe that s enough michael redman

Sentence: glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman is the true story of the regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war broderick play robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldier into battle shaw the son of well to do abolitionist hailed from boston high society the letter he wrote home to his parent during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory a the film begin in shaw is a captain in the northern force like private eriksson michael j fox in casualty of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy force shaw experience first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet graz his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train black in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldier who laid down their life to free their brother from slavery the film periodically jump between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldier the movie introduces u to a handful of black recruit and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying a a runaway slave with a big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he remove his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scar from his day a a slave it make your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear roll down washington s cheek and will probably run down your cheek a well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoe because his foot were covered with oozing sore freeman is a usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role he play a grave digger who ha buried more white soldier than he care to remember he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldier holding the group together and serving a a liaison to the white officer colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher make an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friend searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drill to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment the soldier suffer innumerable hardship but somehow they never lose their morale the army treat the black soldier like second class citizen subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only a month whereas their white counterpart earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoe gun or uniform to make matter worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the black into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives it boot uniform rifle and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw ha absolute faith in his soldier and he fight tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it mean threatening a general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scene where shaw stand up for the regiment unfortunately however broderick s uneven performance is in many respect the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sport a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slip in and out of a phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing a shaw since much of the time his emotion seem forced the film place too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldier who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with it harrowing depiction of war the movie show the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory doe not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and gut except for a few bullet wound and one exploding head the film for the most part leaf the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scene in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it s just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething film them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldier the movie depicts some of but not enough of their custom and ritual in one scene for example the soldier motivate themselves by singing prayer around the campfire each man ha a chance to relay a few word of inspiration a couple of the movie s most touching moment involve young black child looking up to the black soldier with awe disbelief and pride the regiment s greatest triumph come when the soldier distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peer and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory ha it share of gloom and despair but ultimately it prof to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history book say or more precisely what they do not say black played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america

Sentence: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minute of finn taylor s first feature film dream with the fish when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pay off with a potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectation however are soon vanquished a the film settle upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely a funny a it aspires to be nor nearly a affecting a it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half the film s central character are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claim to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick life in the apartment building across from terry who spy on the tryst between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeter upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch and eventually con terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pill of course terry find that the pill do not end up having the presumed lethal effect and he angrily set out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nick s condition he only ha a handful of week left terry s compassion kick in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasy and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him this is a promising premise and mr taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious way from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the character terry is a repessed mournful character who want to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but want to live and take the easy route out by turning dream with the fish into a typical lark where the two character engage in a series of generally dull exploit and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character this is by the number plotting buddy movie road movie redux however dream with the fish is most hampered not by it uninspired storyline but by the character which carry the story it help in such a film to have at least one of the protagonist be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the film s leading character are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plight and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploit far from a romp this fatal flaw make dream with fish more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempt at emotional resonance in the latter stage of the film a the two men begin to bond mr taylor s dialogue sporadically fall flat in dream with the fish while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often come across instead a hopelessly contrived witness such line a you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that s provocative leaf room for further question the film enjoys a few inspired moment the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip but unfortunatetely these instance are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fish register more a attempt rather than actual success this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence a terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital i m realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lip which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempt sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him this is not a film which ha the wherewithal to kill off it leading star in the opening ten minute the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempt at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering fresh faced character he would have been terrific a the lead for george huang s swimming with shark who get to apply his adeptness for timidity a terry mr taylor ambitiously employ an interesting visual technique where the portion of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated a opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scene the charge of dream with the fish s protagonist being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for film with unlikeable character and indeed in many case have i been in the minority supporting film which have been condemned a interminable due to the difficult audience unfriendly nature of their character for dream with the fish though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die

Sentence: for his directoral debut gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent alcoholic husband and father and the various life he affect but while the character place and event may have special meaning to the writer director the audience is left in the dark the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ray winstone and the film focus on him and the people who orbit around him he spends his day hanging out with his friend at pub and girlie bar then he return home to his pregnant wife valerie kathy burke and their five year old daughter raymond demonstrates his violent tendency and his paranoid delusion early on when he accuses valerie s brother billy charlie creed mile of stealing raymond then proceed to beat and bite him to a bloody wreck but these are the least of billy s problem billy is a heroin addict on the downturn and it doesn t seem that he ll last much longer billy and valerie s mother janet laila morse is raymond s nemesis she disapproves of him and he of her but is powerless to do anything about it she merely struggle on hoping her child will survive their respective torment if this description seems bleak i haven t told the half of it this is not a cheery movie and most of the time it s downright depressing while at time it is interesting to watch to see just what make raymond tick and why no one ever simply call the cop on him in the end it s not quite worth it there are too many scene which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose take for example the extended sequence where one of billy s scuzzy friend defends a stray puppy the film is filled with these character moment that never really achieve anything granted there are a few genuinely powerful and sickening moment in the film but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than u the actor do a fine job particularly in the central role the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman know how to write good scene and the actor in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there s no one to restrain oldman from making poor choice a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience oldman got it about half right

Sentence: in tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather wa it deep nope however it wa a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up it wa natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it wa without the comic book uplift of the indiana jones and superman picture which wa true if what you were looking for wa the tale of a heroic man s escadapes and adventure you were looking in the wrong place if those film were tom sawyer then batman wa huckleberry finn some critic glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone realized that it wa something special mr lovell gave it and wrote that this is batman a batman should be mr travers called it one of the ten best film of the year the praise wa deserved from start to finish the film wa enthralling exciting and superb in every respect there wa no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton the result wa batman return which forgets that it want to be fun within the first five minute the villain the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman take over and our epectations are always left unfulfilled when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman s nose he simply get mad and when we want catwoman to slither over batman s body she get pushed off a building i admire mr burton for trying to do more then entertain but the result is a mess nothing work out a planned it fails both to entertain and to enlighten hint are made to the audience that this film could be a blast ala these are only hint there are don t misunderstand me several moment of cinematic genuis contained catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said christopher lloyd is trapped by the penguin within a giant cage a small basket is dropped into a large river but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis a weak followup both career and sequel wise batman return is sometimes dazzling but to often dissapointing

Sentence: stephen please post if appropriate mafia crime isn t a funny business by homer yen c on a particular night when i found myself having some free time i had a chance to either go to sleep early or to see mafia a spoof of mafia and crime film such a the godfather goodfellas and casino at minute in length i thought that i could enjoy a few laugh before getting a good night sleep but by my account i think that my laff o meter only registered a few grin one giggle and maybe one chortle i suppose that you could justify your time a homage to the venerable hollywood star lloyd bridge who just recently passed away and whose last performance wa in this film mafia chronicle vincenzo cortino s lloyd bridge life separated from his family when he wa young he escape to america and try to live an honest life but a fate would have it vincenzo grows up to be a powerful and klutzy crime lord following in his footstep are his two son joey billy burke and anthony jay mohr like all sibling in powerful crime family they squabble over power the future of the family fortune and woman mafia is co written by jim abraham who also contributed to some gut busting funny spoof such a airplane and the naked gun but these previous movie were funny because the joke seemed more universally understood and there wa more of a manic silliness at work a i write this i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movie on which this spoof is based crime movie in general contain a lot of profanity and violence it s a tough genre to parody i wa kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movie maybe by having all of the tough crime lord say please a they decide which sector to take over but this opportunity wa never explored there were one or two moment that made me smile such a the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter in law a gunman shoot him several time the impact of the bullet cause him to make these wild contortion that force the wedding band to change music style to keep up with him from the samba to disco to the macarena i think that i just gave away the best part of the film oh well that just mean that you can go to sleep a little earlier

Sentence: when the haunting arrived in theater all i kept hearing about wa the overdone special effect and the fact that very often the unseen bump in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effect while i agree that this remake of the haunting go a bit overboard in the visual effect department i don t think that they are completely to blame for this movie s failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terror and it wa about a scary a a dust bunny so special effect or not if the story isn t the least bit scary you aren t going to end up with a very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie wa the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minute of screen time he wa still the most interesting element of the movie a i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effect i kept wishing that this movie wa about dern s caretaker and not the one dimensional character that populated the cast never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson play a scientist who is conducting experiment on fear he decides the best way to get result is to trick a group of fairly unstable individual to spend a few day in a haunted mansion he trick them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion ha a reputation for strange going on catherine zeta jones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subject like the original taylor s character is the star of the movie but since she doesn t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and m zeta jones their part did seem to be a big larger than in the original and let s face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones i ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren t in it but the real star here is the special effect combined with the fairly overdone set they take over the movie a the supernatural element of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patient there really isn t much of a story here just endless setup so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effect that he got to play with and the special effect are great in many case they are a good a you are likely to see anywhere in other case they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shot quota at no point in the movie do any of these thing ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when i first saw the house i wa very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took a short tour by the character around the place to see that the set designer obviously had a much money to burn a the visual effect people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included a flooded hallway with book a stepping stone and a mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these room play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our mind off the fact that there wa neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie then we have the actor lili taylor ha never been one of my favorite and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she come in around the average or slightly below mark i have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character wa in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all print of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copy of darkman zeta jones wa cast because she is too hot for word the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake all catherine ha to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she doe very well while she doe have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie wa a eye candy it s too bad someone of her talent wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of s horror movie the blair witch project the haunting had a seemingly limitless effect budget while blair witch relies on pile of rock for it scare both prove quite nicely that special effect are irrelevant to a horror film if the story suck it s all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effect go rent star war if it s scare you want rent halloween either way it s probably in your best interest to skip the haunting

when i see a pair of second or third rate celebrity engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award it s not my fault i know it s not my fault but dammit someone s got ta be embarrassed because it doesn t look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame i m about to give you a list of name of people who are gon na make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these name make you instantly shudder the answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individual we ve got here granted john goodman wa in the flintstone and greg kinnear ha turned in some less than lackluster leading man performance in certified failure like a smile like yours but even so they ve got proven power a excellent supporting player garry shandling ha two television classic under his belt his ingenious little it s garry shandling s show and the larry sander show and for god s sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purport to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and woman satirizing the whole pop psychology mar venus phenomenon but what this movie wind up being is a collection of unfunny cringe inducing moment coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moment the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringe inducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling play an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant male they reproduce through cloning of course his leader put a select group of male through a series of test designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the specie and impregnate her they re taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying uh huh and how to compliment shoe imagine my delighted surprise when oh heaven all their carefully practiced tactic turn out to fail miserably producing comedic result the lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generation of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population ha stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clone whoop too late the penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise the writer when frequently strapped for idea tend to turn to this a a source of comedy it isn t funny the first time it isn t funny the eighth time it isn t funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely self conscious garry meet up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turn out to be a generic unlikable scumbag he s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling s alien character but he s so flatly drawn that even the writer quickly give up and toss him aside kinnear s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claim other people work a his own to worm his way into a vice president position and go to aa meeting to pick up chick wow what a magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played a the same sort of sex driven slimeball when kinnear s wife walk into the office there isn t a single guy who doesn t trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall a if they d never seen a woman before the few guy that aren t particularly slimeballs such a john goodman s detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholic shandling meet up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnear s aa meeting shandling s mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desire to her bening instantly fall for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turn out she want a baby too bening s character perhaps wa the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seam so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the specie a a whole then woe i say to the specie she s unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandling s line and lie that it border on tragic there s a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear child she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry come home after nearly cheating on her she stroll into the kitchen and sings high hope you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then say to him now you can t leave me we re supposed to empathize with shandling s discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she wa placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing and eventually shandling fall in love with her for real i suppose though i m not sure exactly what prompted it what s the message i derive from all this men are liar inherently empty creature but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha i m thankful such broad cynicism isn t frequently allowed to run so rampant let s all join hand and pray that the planet these folk are from is not this one there s also a subplot involving john goodman a an airline incident investigator that wade in the bog of stupidity goodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realization put together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis it ha all the making for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never come to the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and fall away further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brother movie but let s not dwell on this any longer i ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own let s move on forget about what we ve seen here and get on with our life and to

Sentence: starring shawnee smith donovan leitch ricky paull goldin kevin dillon billy beck the blob is the remake of the s classic a term that i use very loosely to define the original about a really mean glob of goop that take out anything that get in it way now the original version ha the virtue of cheesy special effect which give it a kind of nostalgic campy feel the fact that steve mcqueen wa the star of the film doesn t exactly hurt it either fast forward to the late s steve mcqueen isn t in the remake this might have something to do with the fact that he had been pushing up daisy for year nor is there any hollywood heavy hitter in the lead role that is unless you count matt dillon s brother kevin a a hollywood heavy hitter the other thing that work against this new blob is that special effect technology ha improved dramatically since the original the only thing you need now to have great special effect in a movie are deep pocket it look a if the produce of the new blob had a couple of hole in their pocket the special effect in this movie are cheesy like the original s unlike the original they don t look campy they just look cheap one bright spot in the movie from a purely sexist point of view is shawnee smith she is very attractive and can actually act which is more than i can say about some of her costars in term of plot a little ball of pink goop fall from the sky seems this goop wa an experiment that wa being housed up on a satellite anyway the pink stuff ha a taste for human the more people it absorbs the bigger it get and it isn t the friendliest goop on the block either anyway it attack this little town and it s up to the attractive local teenage population to stop it not really but that is how it seems this version attempt to recapture the camp of the original a i ve already said this new version of the blob come off more a cheap badly acted and badly written than campy in the year since this film wa made none of the cast have gone on to greatness although star shawnee smith had a very tiny role in armageddon the reason that we have never heard of any of them again is quite simple they all stunk out loud although some of the film s smaller role are filled with some actor that while not big star are doubtless people that you will recognize from their supporting role in other movie and tv show it also appears that the producer of the blob tried to compensate for the lack of a special effect budget by making the scene in which the blob make meal of the townsfolk a gory a possible sadly it doesn t work very well if you want to see a big ball of goop terrorize a town then i would say that you should skip the remake and rent the original although that isn t so hot either this newest version is seriously lacking in any redeeming quality

Sentence: capsule the running gag pair of character from all of kevin smith s film get their own movie the gag are sporadically funny it is more than occasionally funny for teen who are fond of scatological humor and anti gay joke the plot is weak and the lead are not a particularly funny comic team the little inside joke and dig at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith film are the best feature of the film sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching this feel like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kid do on talent night and it turn out he had very good reason low to a film need a plot it need character for empathy value it need a story and an emotional center if a film is just a chain of joke it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the joke are kevin smith ha now made two satisfying film clerk and chasing amy with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith s fecal monster in dogma were not the way to do it his remaining two film mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay joke penis joke flatulence joke film pastiche and in joke how funny the joke are will be a subjective call for me the vast majority of the joke were just not very funny there wa not enough cleverness or variety it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay penis joke work only so many time showing up a minor character in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gag they were sort of the modern equivalent of naunton wayne and basil radford the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post war film including dead of night the lady vanishes and passport to pimlico jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation stoner a the series wore on they had larger and larger part in jay and silent bob strike back they are the lead jay and silent bob played by jason mewes and kevin smith are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drug in clerk this leaf them at loose end they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their life when they hear that a comic book with character visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie they decide to devote their life to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventure along the way the film is mostly about their adventure on the road and when they get to hollywood the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pull his weight to make the film funny silent bob being silent can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his this make his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have jay ha to be the comic he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny he is too bland to be the comic half and his line just do not show any comic flair so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team their starring role and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gag they have seen before sometimes just minute before like dogma before it but definitely not like chasing amy this film feel more like an amateurish skit than a real movie certainly neither the plot nor the character are at all involving they are excuse for gag many of which still fall flat it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content the film doe not offer much to an adult audience i rate it on the to scale and a low on the to scale

amicable superior gu john c reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment a they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minute and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves a high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them i think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibility of this situation ever occurring so i the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scene show u just how much of a dork she truly wa and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other character do appear that make some of these high school scene both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love story between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette come into her new found life and even cause a rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage film it is chalk full of sexual innuendo and condom humor one scene in particular feature a certain classroom activity involving banana and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other joke are straight forward high school humor that anyone who ha ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rule come the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two level having some very black and white transition and although some scene are written to be particular shade of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she make a mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draw the attention of an audience a simply unrealistic it is these quality that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream take home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and a a central character he get to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done part of never been kissed in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he doe an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the hit risky business never been kissed is a mediocre film at best the predictable plot ha become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just a bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenager will pay to see any trash

Sentence: star war episode i the phantom menace director george lucas cast liam neeson ewan mcgregor natalie portman jake lloyd ian mcdiarmid samuel l jackson oliver ford davy terence stamp pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniel screenplay george lucas producer rick mccallum runtime min u distribution century fox rated pg mild violence thematic element copyright nathaniel r atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review i ve attempted to obey this rule in recent month but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who go to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star war trilogy mean so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity a a child they are masterful original work of art that mix moving story with what were astonishing special effect at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well i am too young to have seen star war in the theater during it original release but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star war trilogy and the empire strike back in particular are three item on a very short list of why i love movie when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series i got exited when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation and when the first preview were released last thanksgiving i wa ready to see the film but then there wa the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture in the last week before the picture opened while multitude of fan waited outside of theater and stood in the boiling sun day in advance just to be the first one in the theater i wa tired of hearing about it i wa tired of seeing cardboard cut out of the character whenever i went to kfc or taco bell i just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have an anti hype reaction the hype wa unavoidable i understand and accept the hype it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved film of all time get released five minute into the phantom menace i knew there wa a problem who are these jedi knight i asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren t these character being developed before their adventure why is there a special effect shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my question early on later i asked where s the magic of the first three film and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minute by the end of the film i wa tired maddened and depressed george lucas ha funneled his own wonderful movie into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star war film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effect movie of all time it s an embarrassment i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effect shot isn t used there are a few of each but they re all token attempt the fact is george lucas ha created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effect this is not what i wanted to see i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did the story center mostly around qui gon jinni liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely ha a line in the film and their attempt to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly care for her people after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon know that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knight take the boy with them on their journey the bad guy are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough line to register a character there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas ha handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinni not one thing what wa his life like before this film well i imagine he didn t have one that s why he feel like a plot device this probably explains why neeson look so hopeless in the role and why he s recently retired from film i don t blame him honestly obi wan a character i wa really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor ha just a few line so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas ha served u a big emotional void a the centerpiece of his movie thing start to pick up when our character reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd doe a thoughtful job with the role i wa also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin say goodbye to his mother i found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth ha been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying character i ve ever had to endure but he s more interesting than most of the human a soon a the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it s back to the mind numbing special effect and depthless action scene i ve seen many movie that qualify a special effect extravaganza but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effect fifteen minute into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas ha no restraint i can t say that i didn t find the effect original because i did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional a is most of the film but i also found the effect deadening and tiresome my breaking point wa near the end of the picture a anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi master in the background we see hundred of digital spaceship flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effect shot i got so sick of looking at the cgi character and spaceship and planet and background that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hour and then there s the question of magic what wa lost in the sixteen year between the phantom menace and return of the jedi i have a feeling that lucas wa so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction i think it come right down to character there are none here i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectation mine weren t that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the root of the film that i grew up loving a story that had a few character and a few great special effect instead i got two hour and fifteen minute of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphic show i don t hate the phantom menace a much a i resent it i d like to forget that it exists and yet i can t it s here to stay i can only hope that episode ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don t then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series

Sentence: martial art master steven seagal not to mention director ha built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial art superman who never get hurt in fight talk in a hushed tone and squint at any sign of danger he s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movie suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendency about his art that is martial art i m sure the guy s good and he seems like a nice guy on talk show although a tad haughty but these movie he make are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then come back with a vengeance and go buddha on all the baddie ass although i kinda liked under siege of course this one a a change ha a message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blow up a lot of stuff and kill a bunch of people so why do i watch his crap i usually don t i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this man s movie unless and only unless he s in a supporting role i e executive decision and i d definitely pay if he dy i e executive decision but this one ha a special place in my heart this doesn t mean it s good or that i even liked it this wa the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre and this wa a couple year before i had heard of mystery science theatre in this one seagal play a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine want to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine ha him bumped off or doe he seagal is rescued by some inuit and fall in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine s cliched henchman played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoot the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal give a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any option but blow stuff up he even go a far a to say i don t want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is i have no problem with violence i m a huge john woo fan but he paint his film with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the film of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some point they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain ha the advantage can shoot seagal but begin talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal say something hokey back and ha had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and doe this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer s con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message i wouldn t mind if this wa a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal ha no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer s mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can t take him and his motif seriously and while seagal talk about being kind to the environment he also go ahead and blow up a square mile of rig and kill some worker who were just doing his job then at the end he spends a good minute giving a speech just in case you didn t get the message from the trailer what seagal doesn t realize is that no one take his film seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he ha is no only redundant but doesn t comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and character who have about a much emotional depth a a petri dish a far a seagal and his acting he s rather boring he squint he kill period nothing else oh yeah there s corny one liner i m gon na reach out and touch someone of course he s the star and we re supposed to root for him and all so he make all the villain unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerk michael caine who s a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he doe it well i guess but this is no alfie of coure no one wa expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring a well but is not horrible and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeant on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket a a hired assasin squad leader who get to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailer and for seagal s ego and also look for billy bob thornton a one of ermey s assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal s movie is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one ha that message which make it more excrucitating to watch i mean if you do rent it and i don t reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minute but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle wa a pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock

Sentence: starring william baldwin cindy crawford steven berkoff all right the first problem that fair game ha is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role not that cindy doe that bad it s just that anyone who watch this film know from moment one that that little bit of casting wa not done because of cindy s extraordinary acting skill but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation and in fair game most situation tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty but i m sure that that is just a coincidence no doubt that these situation were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy look great wet well that s just a happy coincidence sure william baldwin isn t a bad actor unfortunately he just doesn t demonstrate it at all in this movie i m not sure if that s because most of his line were just so hokey or if he wa trying to make cindy s acting look good if it wa the latter it worked cindy doe a surprisingly good job here in her first movie which is not to say that she doesn t have room for improvement although to be fair to cindy her line were kinda cheesy in place so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie doe cindy crawford arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet chose for her foray into the world of cinema well i m glad you asked that question cindy play a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twist becomes a target for former elite kgb agent why woud they target someone a likable a cindy you ask by the end of the movie you won t care the story is so contrived it isn t funny anyway after cindy get blown out of the window of her house without getting so much a a scratch i might add she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin who s character max kilpatric a police detective seems to possess the skill of some sort of fighting machine my guess is that the writer have seen way too many of steven seagal s early film the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin s character of the run from these killer russian isn t all that bad of an idea it s just everything around that basic idea which kinda stink out loud the supporting cast member are nothing more that over acted stereotype if i wa baldwin i d hope this film disappears a for crawford she may indeed have some acting ability unfortunately any she doe have is obscured by writing that go beyond bad this movie wa obviously written with cindy in mind since the writer spend most of their time finding way to capitalize off of her look it s too bad they hadn t spent more time on a half decent plot since m crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you

Sentence: man this wa one wierd movie similar to conspiracy theory in that it couldn decide which genre it is the first hour is your standard stock alien clone which nicely created an eerie atmosphere about the ship the last half hour this wa when the maker blew the script out the airlock and just decided screw it let s just kill everybody from then on forget sci fi this movie becomes horror what really dissappointed me about this movie wa that it tried to scare you in entirely the wrong way instead of using clever trick or trying to build up to a scare this movie just us loud noise sudden camera shift and short quick burst of gore yawn everyone s seen it all before and know when to expect it the one thing that wa done well wa the lead up to finding out about what happened to the previous crew there are skeleton lying around mangled and mashed but what did this then finally after being painfully restored the new crew view the video the acting isn t too bad at all considering what the actor had to work with anyway a there is no complex or interesting dialogue to speak of there wa some very nice camerawork in certain sequence though like when the hull near the bridge of the event horizon is breached and the camera pan back to follow specific object a they bounce across the deck and are sucked out into space this movie could have been so much better it had a good experienced cast who deserved more to work with there wa just nothing new here that any of u haven t seen before in alien or hellraiser

Sentence: movie like six day seven night make me mad because talented people like harrison ford anne heche and ivan reitman put a lot of hard work in to a script worth about ten cent the script wa written by michael browning and he decided that instead of thinking up new idea he d rehash a lot of cliche omit even the slightest bit of character development and then throw in drug dealing pirate to provide for a few high level action sequence and explosion there are good script out there that high profile actor can make see the truman show for instance six day seven night is simply a waste let s see we have to get harrison ford and anne heche alone on an island so how do we do that well we ll make her a feisty magazine editor and we ll make him a crusty old pilot but wait she ha to have a fianc e that can be david schwimmer but wait if she ha a fianc e how will she and harrison ford crash on the island alone i know they ll get to their vacation spot and then she ll get called back yessssss so they ll crash on the island and that will be funny for about five minute shuck oh i ve got it we ll throw in a distracting subplot in which her fianc e ha sex with a really attractive woman who act like a bimbo and then he can feel guilty then when anne heche kiss harrison ford they have to kiss because otherwise nobody will want to see the movie it will be a vindicated action because her fianc e will already have cheated on her then for no obvious reason they ll accidentally run into pirate who try to kill them oh yes i feel so good about this story instead of using characterization to propel the event it will be completely random and yet totally predictable imagine that don t get me wrong six day seven night is not a boring picture ford and heche both do a great job the spark fly between them and so most of browning s inane dialogue is drowned out by the actor sheer force of talent almost every scene between them ha energy that the performer bring to the screen and i found myself laughing pretty hard schwimmer is also funny and manages to milk all of his scene for whatever he can get and reitman who ha made some good film at least try to make thing exciting even though the pirate subplot is profoundly dumb i wa prepared to be pleasantly sidetracked by the action sequence it s just when i start to think about the story that my contempt for this film surface the picture feel like it s been hacked to piece i wouldn t be surprised if five or six inept subplots have been edited out completely the one that are here are a bad a they come i think i let out a very audible groan when they get the first glimpse of the pirate ship and i d just like to shake the producer by the shoulder and scream why did you pick this awful script the film is outright stupid but some of the element are subtly horrifying for instance take the subplot in which the schwimmer character ha sex with the bimbo and then feel really guilty this is a serious problem in real life but six day seven night reduces any chance of complexity to a weak plot device his action are what make it okay for heche to kiss ford in a script that lack even a glimpse of intelligent subtlety i find it odd that such a strangely insulting device ended up in the story this is summer movie season but that doesn t mean our movie have to be dumb so far ha been one of the worst year in recent memory for summer blockbuster when i wa in line for six day seven night i heard the woman in front of me ask for two ticket to that new harrison ford movie why didn t she know the name of the film i suppose she just didn t care what bother me even more is that the people who make these big budget picture don t realize that their film are becoming parody of themselves good actor should sign to good script and if hollywood insists on making flick to rake in cash they least they could do is assume that we d like to spend our money on a story worth more than ten cent

Sentence: the kid in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer maybe after watching a half dozen kid in the hall movie they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are a big fan of the kid skip the film a it is their first and most likely only attempt at a full length film lack the quality that made their comedy work on tv a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kid go through the motion but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this make it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antic brain candy is a bunch of skit tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression in typical sketch comedy tradition each actor play several role doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceutical dr cooper release the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drive the rest of the film at about minute brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedy and the kid are no exception is the ability to quickly deliver the laugh then go on to another quick skit but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer coherent story the laugh just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it wa when on cable tv the movie make several attempt at risqueness mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompson character but they seem almost forced a if they have to live up to a pg rating one of the best bit though doe make use of thompson naked buttock we see him charging into battle going to have sex with some guy taking a shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kid unfortunately are not up to the task there are some amusing moment to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one

Sentence: two party guy bob their head to haddaway s dance hit what is love while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub it s barely enough to sustain a three minute skit but producer lorne michael creator amy heckerling and paramount picture saw something in the late night television institution s recurring roxbury guy sketch that would presumably make a good feature emphasis on the word presumably take an already thin concept and tediously stretch it far beyond the breaking point and that of viewer patience level the first five minute or so of play very much like one of the original roxbury guy skit with what is love blaring on the soundtrack the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi chris kattan and will ferrell bob their head scope out hotties at club and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrust there is one crucial difference however these guy speak that little fact ha been used a justification for the film s existence that the butabis newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of door for the character the door opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriter steve koren ferrell and kattan are new that s for sure but they all lead to comic dead end there is no story per se only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots the brother literally run into or rather get run into a in by car richard grieco of fame and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club there they meet a hotshot club owner chazz palminteri conspicuously uncredited can you blame him who take an interest in an idea of theirs meanwhile the bros overbearing father dan hedaya want them to stop clubbing when doug refuse and the dimwitted steve obeys his father a rift is created between the two the narrative messiness of would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny but virtually none of it is the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end ala the joke a rather lazy takeoff on will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film granted a lot of people seen but the fact that the film s best joke is completely dependent on one s familiarity with another film say a lot about s lack of inspiration that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid character themselves like too many of the skit on the current incarnation of the roxbury guy is a one joke sketch that never once suggests that the character have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context after watching one of the roxbury skit on snl this is what you come away with from the character they bob their head to what is love bump unsuspecting woman and that s all after watching you ll be left with exactly the same
