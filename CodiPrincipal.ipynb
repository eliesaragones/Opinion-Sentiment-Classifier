      "Opinió: those of you who frequently read my review are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo s novel le miserables i don t know if a lot of people have though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel i haven t even seen that going into this film i had almost no knowledge of the story or it character i even expected the film to be a musical walking away from it i m kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material writer director bille august s film version is a straightforward beautifully told film liam neeson star a the miserable jean valjean in the beginning he ha just been released from a year prison sentence he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior the priest s word of wisdom influence him and he make a vow to change himself nine year later we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo nobody know his real name and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine year ago conflict arise when inspector javert geoffrey rush is assigned to vigo valjean remembers javert a one of the prison guard who constantly beat him and javert remembers jean to be a convict javert is hell bent on upholding the law and he doe everything in his power to bring jean to justice along the way valjean meet and fall in love with a peasant woman fantine uma thurman and vow to take care of her daughter cosette played later by claire dane le miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast and the set don t look like set they look like real town and village gabriella pescucci s costume are noticeably spectacular basil poledouris soundtrack is thick and usually well placed though it doe get a bit heavy at time many scene in the film have a memorable photographic quality such a the climax which take place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening august keep the story simple which i hear is a good thing since the novel is so complex and easy to follow he manages to develop the main character and most of the subplots adequately i wa also impressed that he didn t go overboard with flash and style which is something so many director seem to be doing to classic story these day such a baz luhrmann s vicious tragedy william shakespeare s romeo juliet this film feel solid and whole and each scene ha a certain amount of importance and vigor that keep the audience interested liam neeson is terrific in the main role neeson is the kind of actor who doe solemn desperation extremely well and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fit that adjective thurman in her small role is very good and prof that she ha a lot of range and can perform in a very non glamorous role such a this one rush is absolutely incredible a javert i don t remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain a i do here he add depth and complexity with subtle glance and nuance and effortlessly make each of his scene intense i can t be a charitable for dane however though i know she is a talented actress here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit le miserables is a i ve said a solid intelligent motion picture my only complaint is that it feel a bit too easy and perhaps too staged each scene is grand and huge and exploding with poledouris score but i didn t always want them to be for the most part le miserables is not a subtle or deep picture it s a good movie and tell it story well but august tends to hand feed u theme and scene that would have worked better had they been more subtle however in a film this exciting and well produced a few minor flaw are easily overlooked | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",
      "Opinió: this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff s play hospitality suite it about three travelling salesman attending an industrial convention whose chicago company ha sent them to wichita where the company ha paid all their expense for them to rent a hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricant and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revel in salesman talk among the three white christian male two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesman having teamed together for the last twelve year while bob facinelli is a young man who ha just recently been hired by the firm and work in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna a the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interaction in the hospitality suite the three salesman have different thing on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal change that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast try to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what come into question is their opinion on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough question and the truth seems to

film try to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that get these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him what make this film different than the others is it blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do a both must sell their product and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life ha sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of good they sold themselves that made them be salesman larry and phil have one way of doing thing and have no qualm of incorporating a sale pitch a part of their life bob think he is above the fray and he pitch every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his action the word of jesus he literally belief in bob is a baptist who take a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he read the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can t even say because he love her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personality is stark larry is all business he simply want to close the sale he come into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot stick rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tell him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best year have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now find himself suffering from some troubling dream and questioning what he belief in he ha always been a charmer shaking everyone s hand trying to please his client while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive a a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenty and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesman throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throw a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act a the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but wa wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tell the boy about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sale pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product a they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesman are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their as the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room a they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their life these three performer were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that it more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a

and even a mix of the two with france mcdormand in fargo in all case and in o brother too the character populating their film are three dimensional people ulysses everett is a handsome hair obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brain department but he seems like a genius when compared to the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of million their odyssey take on the mystical proportion of homer s original material a they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous siren who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoal and a cyclops who beat them and take all their money there is magic too when delmar belief that pete wa turned into a horny toad by the siren the story meander through the different vignette of the boy adventure giving the flick a choppy episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow some of the interlude are an epiphany though the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar playing tommy johnson chris thomas king and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere run by it blind owner stephen root they become the soggy bottom boy for the sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded a they sing the traditional tune i am a man of constant sorrow it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and give u in my mind the best movie song of the year contrasting this and other wonderful moment the sexy seduction by the siren come to mind are some pretentious bit that detract from the overall quality of o brother in particular near the end is a scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched the scene is overblown and flashy and reek of the wizard of oz they don t say lion and tiger and bear oh my and there s no dorothy but it is the land of oz we re seeing here the high and low of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several level george clooney is

church congregation in their mass baptism delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that make him shine the taciturn pete a played by longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and give them the necessary angst all together the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooge and the three musketeer a they

road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of a year old english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girl the year old lucy carrie and the year old bea bella ha arrived for a year s stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughter might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she say she is a she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who ha all the answer she ha not planned thing out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn t seem like it s much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drug a world wide youthful phenomenon during this period where many westerner came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authority even though drug are illegal there but this is not shown a one of her reason for being here in this film the subject of drug is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way a the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitar and bragging about the hit of acid they have taken even the one coming here for spiritual reason to follow the mystical sufi seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experience of sigmund freud s grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the director s brother who ha previously directed regeneration the playboy and trojan eddie the title of the film come from the squealing giggle that saying hideous kinky give the little girl with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meet an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband a a father figure for the girl the girl readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girl really don t know what to make of the relationship it especially bother bea who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and want to go home thing go surprisingly sour when bilal take them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness a he ha a wife who still life there this scene didn t make too much sense a to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man wa totally uneducated in the custom of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next a they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kill them when he fall asleep by the wheel lucy take it all in stride and ha a good disposition for travel while bea just want to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet a the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and it bustling street scene expansive view illustrious mosque and grand sunset kate enacts the feel of what it wa like to be a westerner living out the

guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tear are memory a gift from god the film s weakness wa the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in it risk free tenor she wa there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experience many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that ha a lot to offer it follower contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pas her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kid along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film s strength is in how all the character are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcoming bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girl are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who care about the child but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she wa trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she ha another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmare about where she s at this is a very freudian way to look at thing a

consequence of rapid social change that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give argument for both side his travis bickle ha a lot in common with most of the average viewer of today many of u share his feeling of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drug prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempt to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstance like with secret service agent pimp or job interviewer make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewer are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizen or troubled soul from fanatical madman but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheer for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person want but doesn t have a stomach lack of brain to do it while de niro s

atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz element give some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of

time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story everyone ha their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several character chance encounter all effect each other in extreme way in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of character that wouldn t usually be the type to have an entire film revolve around them such a a teenage supermarket cashier a bottom of the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actor these type of character might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a mid level drug dealer a narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guest a zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round thing out how they will all come together is the process the film deal with i d imagine the concept to the film started out a the creator testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film start out a anything else with little indication of what s to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent she s not very charming especially to her customer but this is played mostly for laugh rather than characterization and it work maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character but she s far from masculine a creative character indeed thing start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hour of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vice for the sake of the experience this agreement start a three pronged storyline a it allows simon to go to la vega for the weekend with his friend and in turn drag ronna and her friend into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other character zack mohr and adam wolf who we don t think much of when they first appear a supporting character but later will become major player to the film s makeup another process used by the filmmaker to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begin to show it mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movie today and so the film begin to take shape first by following ronna and her friend on a one night adventure that begin with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn t exactly go a planned but that s what keep it all so interesting the second storyline start at the same moment a ronna s story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friend head to vega for a night on the town and in the process experience thing they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlap with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle we re shown thing we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the event that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were i d really like to dissect each of the three storyline and especially how the film wrap up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is it constant surprise and unpredictability and not due to plot twist or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film doe so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such a liman it s a great accomplishment he doesn t just depict a story he wrap u up in it all pulling u into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general it s clear the script ha been inspired by many source with both obvious and subtle reference yet it never scream rip off tone mood where other hollywood film have failed to bring the charm of the independent to the mainstream this one is able to create it own sense of the macabre it s not overly dark or twisted and the comedy isn t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we re able to get a sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situation even when their action are surprising it never seems very out of synch performance every actor nail their role see above theme theory the film doesn t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social message instead it s more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure see

classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone s taste but certainly a well crafted movie possibly that movie s greatest strength wa that the most important event happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the character future so there wa no need to film it there wa actually about four hour worth of screen story there but eszterhas found way to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what wa really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trail the major element that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirl we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent character we have show for the eye and the ear plotlines that play on several level we have beautifully delineated character who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who s trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slip into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who s not known for treating his character well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movie but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quarter century ha pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limit to movie making his most recent three movie robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drive and now he s exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several part of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewer have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which us naked lady a scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked lady it s about people in an environment where naked lady are common and why such an environment should exist it s about the scum who use other people a power trip toy and the need to escape their power it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human value don t pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scene is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn t sexually exciting say a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex ha been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actor you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few gun going off and a few people getting killed and you don t make a movie about la vega showgirl without showing a few la vega showgirl and in an awful lot of vega show an awful lot of lady wear very

essence pass the torch to nomi the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie and provides part of the impetus nomi need to follow a different path it is no accident that the three important part in this movie are woman of different stripe molly is an honest hard working person who mean well and nearly dy because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality cristal is a talented dancer who s compromised her ideal and sold herself to be a co operating part of the system exchanging self respect for the specie of stardom that can be had in la vega nomi belief she can make it without selling herself succumbs to a degree and then realizes she can make it without selling herself and doesn t need la vega or it brand of stardom the male part in this

      "Opinió: it ha been three long year since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or a million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker ha been virtually invisible surfacing briefly a a co director of the wildly uneven four room and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he ha moonlighted a an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performance now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino ha returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard s novel rum punch offer solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theater disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which start out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double cross and triple cross and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademark witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tune and close ups of womens bare foot yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dog and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous effort an approach that added tension and edginess to the narrative and there aren t nearly a many deliciously offbeat conversation this time around there s a samuel l jackson monologue about gun a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merit of hiding in a car trunk and a jackson robert de niro exchange that recall some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that s about it jackie brown s lone innovation is it presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspective this isn t exactly an original technique it ha been done numerous time before most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire however while in those two movie and others there wa a legitimate plot reason for the multiple point of view tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional had the scene in question been shown from only one of the three vantage nothing would have been lost a a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon this time around instead of john travolta it s blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown ha become jackie brown in one of many nod to the most famous segment of grier s career tarantino us a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credit there are also several instance during jackie brown when the director offer a sly wink towards certain convention of the blaxploitation genre although grier never doe any butt kicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who get caught transporting drug and money into the united state she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keep her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv s banyon to post the necessary then plan to shoot jackie if she prof disloyal jackie pass ordell s test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle of ordell s money into the united state without tipping off the fed soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isn t nearly a invigorating or compelling a character a jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guy who rarely smile role bridget fonda is around for three discernible reason to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clock in at several minute over the two and a half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep u guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keep thing moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabe than something from the director himself when it come to recent caper film like the grifter and bound jackie brown is a second tier effort it s an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",
      "Opinió: one of the biggest cliche of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective look at a wall of picture and other police information and suddenly spot the clue which reveals who the killer is sure it s been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girl work on overused but always fun one of my personal rule about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it go around giving it story this rule applies highly to kiss the girl there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girl is certainly well made however the whole film scream of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of it actor and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actor capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choice by the filmmaker one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make wa to put the name of the killer in the opening credit that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i wa waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girl show almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him a the hero he get a call about a woman who ha shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera ha been missing for four day this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and a a result we can t sympathize with detective cross however what make kiss the girl slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these trait becomes a target for casanova what the serial killer like to call himself because of these character developing scene we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wake up and find herself in a cell somewhere in the wood remembering that the killer gave her certain rule she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova come to punish her she break out and escape by jumping over a waterfall after she is found she begin to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girl take on the form of every other serial killer film a the two lead search for the rest of the victim held captive many people will compare this film to s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarity are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what make kiss the girl so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shot were trying too hard to impress u sometimes a simple shot is the best one however many of the shot are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing make this scene work so well the chaotic and mtv type cutting give the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd s character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girl is it actor morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actor detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven because of freeman s powerful presence he carry half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of today s most promising dramatic actress in fact her performance is better than freeman s if that is even possible her character is more original than freeman s and she handle it wonderfully we finally have a female character in a movie like this who doe more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast member do a much a they can with it cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately ha scrap for a character tony goldwyn fair slightly better but we don t really get to know his character either gina ravera give a good performance but again she isn t in many of the scene so a a result of all these small supporting part the weight of the film lie on the two lead and they do a phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspect of the film are quite good director gary fleder doe a good job of controlling his actor but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scene a a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scene however to his credit he doe manage a terrific first half part of the blame fall on david klass i m sure the book developed many of the lesser character more but klass focus on the two main part while this may give the two lead more screentime many of the small character are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girl always seems intelligent none of the conversation are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problem i had with the movie wa the motive of the killer i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer s motive is because of rejection from woman or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friend is a shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girl is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibility of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girl somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performance the cinematography add a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movie which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor and ashley judd add another notch on her acting belt i must also say that i loved the ending the showdown between good and evil wa quite tense and the resolution of the scene make almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn t anyway | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is a film which address an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy in many way mr niccol s screenplay mirror the spirit of his previous gattaca both film focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal character defining moment occurring at sea although the film s rather conventional climax doesn t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two third and ultimately just fall short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moment through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving a truman attempt to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implication behind his discovery of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issue being broached by the film it remains foremost a finely crafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and a the carefully stacked seahaven house of card tumble down the film eschews any psychological ramification for a man discovering that the fundamental of his entire existence have been false the end act of the truman show essentially boil down to a rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog v the system formula while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some element are lacking the device of mysterious lauren sylvia natascha mcelhone a a contributing impetus to truman s growing awareness isn t exactly convincing there s not much of a discernable spark between either the two character or the actor themselves and the scene in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regard to the moral ambiguity of his action unnecessarily spell thing out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scene depicting the real world outside truman s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shot from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussion felt a the film finally shift outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and it insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti voyeuristic tirade such a that of the recent costa gavras film mad city i ve always believed that the versatile m linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she ha always seems to have a impish gleam in her eye and in the truman show she run rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin a she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogan cheerfully going over the top it s hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that she d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laugh department of a film m linney is a delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rule the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interlude which typify his traditional part but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it s difficult not to root for truman in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which make him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there s an early scene where he s down on his knee gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gag it s almost poetic how this notorious look at me actor successfully tone it down to play a character who s constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performance by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman s antiseptic white picket fenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitz s original score technical credit are first rate all around while the truman show is clearly a definitive high concept film it s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessor utilising common element abound ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner all the same this is a visionary award calibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film s concept seems unfathomably outrageous it s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid

french village of lansquenet where majority rule and the majority life by only one law religion the bulk of the townspeople with few exception are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly non religious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth watering confection in the chocolate shop vianne open many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne s opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent especially the mayor comte de reynaud a cartoon like alfred molina who will stop at nothing to put her out of business on the other hand the shop is a delight to others including the cranky armande voizin judi dench who sits day by day in vianne s shop telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson aurelien parent koening which come a a result of his mother carrie ann moss believing armande is a bad influence a she doe not hold the same strict religious belief that she doe also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat whose husband is constantly beating her to whom vianne offer a home and befriends juliette binoche is charming and honest a vianne genuinely capturing her character s determination to turn the narrow minded townspeople into more happy independent human being but most of chocolat s success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performance of the supporting actress lena olin previously nominated for an oscar in deserves her second nomination for her earnest moving portrayal of a lost scared woman torn between staying true to her battering manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs judi dench is sharp incisive and occasionally greatly touching a armande voizin carrie ann moss in what is likely to be her first largely noticed and acclaimed role since the matrix show a more solid side of her acting skill not previously seen crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously victoire thivisol show much promise a anouk a young girl hoping her always on the move mother will eventually settle down a trade ad for chocolat sum up best the power the actress have on screen with the tagline five extraordinary woman one extraordinary movie that s not to say the men don t do their share though alfred molina make for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist hugh o conor add quite a bit of comic relief a the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is and johnny depp give a strong performance a the pirate roux who enters the film late in the game and spark the romantic interest of vianne the technical aspect of chocolat are strong across the board lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care perfectly balancing the element of each genre to be found within the film cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric fairy tale look to the film and rachel portman s masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rule chocolat adapted by robert nelson jacob from the joanne harris novel is a wonderful little treat of a film one that will most likely win over the heart of audience and the vote of academy member this winter and the aggressive backing of miramax film assures the latter while not a powerful a the cider house rule lasse hallstrom s chocolat is a film which work on all level a a drama a comedy a fable a romance and a fairy tale and it even life up to it name it

      "Opinió: warren beatty s bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesn t attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that ha infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many way it is however a loud and raucous a it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and co wrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sister star a incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who ha one of the best politician name in cinema history bulworth is a democrat and in beatty s view he is symbolic of everything that ha gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth ha long since succumbed to the materialistic pressure of washington instead of waging the battle for the impoverished and the downtrodden which wa once the calling card of democrat bulworth ha become another sell out money hound if he s not accepting illegal bribe from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contribution from the chinese he s making wind bag speech that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium blah blah blah when the film open it is a few day before the primary election and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he ha become in a fit of desperation he take out a million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hire a hit man to kill him although he doesn t know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truth about the state of american politics and the society in general at a compton church he tell the group of african american that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wing and get behind somebody other than a running back who stab his wife later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mix with the hollywood elite then insult the quality of their movie and informs them that the only reason he s there is because my guy always put the big jew on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworth s chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment platt ha some of the movie s funniest scene a he make murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant half truth telling and spin doctoring to cover bulworth s stampede is equaled in it perversion only by a self righteous reporter nora dunn who act like murphy s refusal to explain bulworth s action something he really can not do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he want to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grim looking assassin to be who s trailing him at every turn he hide out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wear to one of his television interview at this point beatty abandon much of the political aspect and dive into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner city experience bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meet at the harlem church rally she ha a tough talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d don cheadle of boogie night who also becomes involved in bulworth s campaign some of the scene in the ghetto ring true but much of it feel like a lighter version of scene depicted in more intense inner city film like boyz n hood and menace ii society bulworth s chief liability is beatty s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap a his new communication device instead of speaking at political rally he break into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip hop star are black it s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether he s actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sound more run d m c than snoop doggy dogg which make the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner city lingo and working that into his speech instead of trying to sound like l l cool j other than that bulworth hit all it target with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you don t agree with beatty s liberal message about the unrequited duty of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film ha in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary color which opened earlier this year bulworth doesn t try to tip toe around the

most mediocre film look good i m happy to say that there s something about mary is not one of those trailer let down in fact watching this film wa quite a fine way to spend two hour the film open up in flashback to at a high school in cumberland rhode island ted stroehmann ben stiller is a social reject who can t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom until he come to the defense of the mentally retarded warren w earl brown who s being harassed by one of the school jock it seems warren s sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up mary take an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom ted wa just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted ha an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital fast forward to the present where ted ha cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but ha weekly therapy session in order to deal with his obsession of the past year mary whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hire slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love however when pat find mary he fall for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affection there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought u dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedy they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friend or co worker to think you had such a great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brother have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic style from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gag might be offensive to some seeming like residual from the farrelly brother last two film they almost all work i have not seen many movie in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute you ll be laughing at something ted say and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment one of the great thing this film ha going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he s a guy who just look awkward in almost every situation ted s a nice fellow and try to do his best but for some reason or another thing just don t always work out it s comical but also ha that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top actually i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighty the film wa like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a big time bowling hustler it wa parody at it finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late early like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that show s cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she date and some of the quality she look for make mary look paper thin at time however diaz pull the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she s got guy just falling over each other to be with her heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it wa annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change and you know it s really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clark s pool house anyway here s another good piece of casting a dillon slip beautifully into the role of the guy who try to worm his way into mary s heart the supporting performance are also good chris elliott ha a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who play mary s neighbor magda and also appeared a the landlady in kingpin provides some good laugh especially in scene with her benji like dog which act a the focal point for a few of the funniest moment of the film lee evans a mary s friend tucker display a flexibility in acting and accent which surprise and contributes to an interesting plot twist the farrelly brother and scriptwriter ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable time where the film drag the only problem i saw wa their use of a couple of musician who provide segue between several key scene they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera it s a device which wa amusing for about three second when they opened the film after that it got a little annoying and it s unfortunate that those spot interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gag humorous line and solid comedic acting there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater | Predicció:

      "Opinió: plot a young recruit get plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others he s got ambition he s got goal and he love everything he see about being the number one gangster violence lot of swearing and betrayal ensue critique a very good serious minded unique british gangster flick which miss the great mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and a so so ending here s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so it s not entirely new but it s definitely original when all put together a done here the thing i liked most about this movie wa it authentic portrayal of the time period in which it wa taking place it s and these dude are looking good yes it s all about the suit fella the italian shoe the cufflink the tie and the bird that s lady for those uninitiated hanging around you here are a bunch of horrible men gangster if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting head all over the place but that s not the basis of this movie the basis of this film come in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his crony paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affect the other you know how there are always these hanger on gangster type who latch on to the godfather the leader the top dog of every crime organization well most of the time these dude are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their bos so all the gangster number one need to worry about is his enemy on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayal the messed up loyalty the honor code among bad guy into play within the same group and present it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isn t trying to be guy ritchie here and doesn t over stylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he go straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scene which are still embedded in my mind a i type this the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eye in fact the last time that i ve seen a guy so scared in a movie wa john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brother miller s crossing scary shite but there s an ever better scene than that in this film this one feature bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that man s point of view but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one that s right he doe the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertone present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his bos why doe he get so upset when he fall in love with that woman but the flick s not perfect in fact i didn t mind malcolm mcdowell s voice over narration at first but a the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented a such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do wa swear and call people the c word umpteen time and even described one scene a it wa happening so i opened the door then went up the lift etc it s like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen overdone i also didn t quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that it s supposed to be taking place year later and folk still seem to be holding grudge still in love still living in the same apartment i mean c mon it s year man i don t know somehow it didn t work all that well for me but one of my favorite genre ha always been the crime movie and this one is a decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell s narration of the obvious plot point and concentrate on the film s stronger attribute such a it style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period it original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group it memorable sequence and the solid performance from it two main lead bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flick that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of film it s the

entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all story are about select moment of time and place in the character life but only the truly great one are able to define their reality well enough so the audience can experience it just a the character do therefore gone with the wind deserves accolade for it ability to tell the epic story it doe in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner it s a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film take place in georgia before during and after the civil war this play a major factor in the film s success to use such a historic setting present many possibility and problem since no one wa alive at the time to verify it accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factor to potential viewer can a story set so long ago be relatable now the film confronts all these problem paradoxically by not cronfronting them it doesn t simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything make sense and said concern are irrelevant building a strong foundation is important to all form of medium without which what is there to build on we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our character especially our main character scarlett o hara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she know how her society work wherein everything she doe can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequence may be being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men and their woman to ensure she get her way whether it be obvious i e who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e getting married just to spite someone the man she claim to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who doe not seem to have the same passion for her a she doe for him he isn t so arrogant and demanding a scarlett in fact he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable character one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friend but she never suspect the jealously scarlett ha for her and the love she ha for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesn t give her much emotional self defense acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story a a whole is the daper stong willed cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable he s quite a character all right everyone listens to what he ha to say even though he s got a bad reputation butler make no apology for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tell everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tell his fellow southerner there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out this anger them not for his lack of faith but because he ha the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factory do we have food do we have a navy all we have is tobacco all true statement and yet the south still insists he s wrong butler is a shifty character to be sure but he take such pride in his arrogance it s appealing scarlett notice this too when she first see him and from the look butler give her we know he s not going to stop until he ha her but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley and during a scene which set the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story go on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflict she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dy this give the film many opportunity to bring in more character into the epic story some are vital for only a few scene but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film in most film only a few character exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable a it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone ha signficance even people in the background seem more than just extra wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the film make for a real sense of time and place the filmmaker could have easily set more scene indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these type of simple approach are never taken the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last day of the civil war fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene ha scarlett working a a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no not my leg don t cut off my leg another scene show her simplying trying to cross a street but a the camera pull back we see that her path is blocked by hundred of wounded soldier but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be a the second half begin the film concentrate more on scarlett a a completely independent woman who single handedly take care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she ha can t help her when she must pay exuberhant tax set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begin their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each us the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other scarlett continues to use her manipulative power over men to get what she want and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she try to one up him such a marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposite attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett go way beyond opposing personality it border on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaf it up to u to make this call both have thing the other want and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate thing and throughout the final act of the film we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotion were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way is possible and it s a mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewing it s safe to say most of u won t live such overly dramatic life a those in gone with the wind but it s still a masterpiece for it

hobbs the baseball player who wa destined to be the best there ever wa but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he wa the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played a man who wa so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford wa still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans redford again play such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who ha the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horse wa just too good to pas up despite his enormous and rare gift when it come to training troubled horse a magazine article coin the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker see himself a an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life booker s talent are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson wa recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horse an eighteen wheeler kill grace s friend severely wound and traumatizes grace s horse pilgrim and cause grace to lose part of her right leg annie belief that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed a well which lead her to booker at first she try to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn t work instead she pack up grace and pilgrim leaf her husband robert sam neill behind and head for the rolling hill of montana where booker run a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister in law diane dianne wiest in many way the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west ha always been a great american tradition of renewal and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana a a variation on the classic theme of city v country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the character arrive in the wide open space of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begin to dissipate annie s controlling nature begin to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just a in love with the grand montana country in this film a he wa when he directed a river run through it six year ago in many way the horse whisperer come from the same poetic vein a river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minute shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountain but then that would ruin the magic much of the film s photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert richardson natural born killer platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which take place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filter and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shift to montana richardson switch to soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a aspect ratio in term of the story itself the horse whisperer give u the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s a brief encounter and clint eastwood s adaptation of robert james waller s the bridge of madison county richard lagravenese co screenwriter here also adapted bridge although the horse whisperer ha a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband fall to sam neill he play the character a a decent hard working man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he love his wife more than she love him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feel about each character it show booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert look somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap a they enter the pen booker assuredly swing over the fence while robert hesitates then open the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it s a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scene in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker s horse training method are mythical and unrealistic the scene with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scene between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moment in the film there are no dramatic sex scene but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty body grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantee unhappiness for just about every character there are enough

it s name to the film s title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia robert walk in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an on again off again love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film open with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom a the title credit appear over a montage of slow motion sequence featuring the actress s appearance in film and at premiere coming out of limousine walking the red carpet and such without word this sequence give u a background to her character following however is a set up narration by william indicating what he doe and where he life i don t know why the filmmaker chose to go with a narration which tell u nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minute of film and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view a he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality win u over easily in fact much of notting hill s strength lie in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricot from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kiss william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn t say a word then add well i ll probably tell myself now and then but i d never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we re constantly exposed to william s thought feeling action and desire but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feel for him there are a couple of instance where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the time in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two make this hugh grant s film hand down he get the great scene look for one in which he ha to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great line and give an overall wonderful performance julia robert fan will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy lean a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans a spike william s eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make u laugh hugh bonneville emma chamber james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard a william s friend and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folk react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it s a scene most of u will probably think would play out in our own living room were we faced with a similar situation roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep u off our foot but doe give u more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instance in this film where large amount of time pas whereas some film are content to simply put in a caption saying eight month later michell present u with more interesting cue such a william s walk though his neighborhood while the season change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred foot in the air we re generally used to scene where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keep going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly a an enhancement to many of the film s scene and some of this might have been better toned down but in other area it work to full effect it s kind of a mixed bag but still fare better than many of today s lighthearted movie which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film ha some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill s grant and robert will not go down in history a

      "Opinió: let me open this one with a confession i love cop movie i adore them with such an unwavering near foolish passion that i wa actually one of the first in line to see s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brother steven wa it any good well just about a good a baldwin s steven seagal impression for those i ve confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i don t love just any cop movie i m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flick that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker i m partial to those gritty earthy cop drama like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these film come along just about a often a george w bush make a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie doe hit multiplex i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movie that transform me into a moron willing to shell out for a movie called one tough cop which actually sound a lot like a wiseguy spin off no truth is i m a sucker for those barren street that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminal lurk and cop like modern day knight must shield u from their iniquitous clutch yes it s all very corny and awfully boy clubish which i m guessing is precisely where these feeling come from a little tot u boy are brought up to create our own war with gi joe s enact cop and robber or cowboy and indian fantasy etc the best gritty cop film tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasy and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral line and psychological chaos a an adult my taste haven t changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexity of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if it s the cop who re the corrupt one ooh that one really get me going these protector using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shift from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a sub genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film star treat williams who give the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i wa hatched a mere two year prior to the release of prince of the city i can not provide an answer a to why it didn t though judging from his recent role in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably ha something to do with quite a few bad career move like mickey rourke and eric robert both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didn t make it to where he should have if there wa any justice in this dog gone world keanu reef would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino s in serpico also directed by lumet williams play danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officer who take down drug dealer on the gritty pre juliani street of new york they work without uniform or hour much like paid vigilante and that analogy is more than apt seeing a how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt mean to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informant low level junky to gain access to the big wig and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junky with the junk of their choice danny ha done this and though he s a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intention have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seek redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affair who then convince him to go undercover a a double agent he doe so with one condition he will not rat on his partner right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop film are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliche like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issue of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city take all this and charge it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet a well a a handful of intense performance most notably by treat lumet s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lay back and let the camera soak up the action his scene transition rapidly from one to the next building layer of tension and he rarely hold for reaction shot instead he click away at precisely the moment a character stop yakking lumet s worst tendency is one that many film maker especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actor shouting their line at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isn t a much a problem here a it wa in night fall on manhattan lumet s most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet ha made several really awful career choice maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he wa on sustaining tension in a film that run for minute with not one dull spot some of the formula picture i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kind of picture even tolerable of course cop movie aren t popular anymore yes buddy cop flick are popular but those are more like extended sitcom with gunfire amid the punch line but just look at the average hollywood action movie flick so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serf no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn t gay the lame comic relief character who s never funny and on and on for all it moral ambiguity prince of the city is a back to the basic cop courtroom drama that leaf out all the crap and really thrill it focus completely on it story and it character all of whom are completely believable from the cop to the lawyer to the junky there s a great scene early on where an irate williams shout at an ia officer and look a if he s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speech but instead he break down in front of the cop and begin sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifice his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that make him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the word out he s lost his voice doe that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the

      "Opinió: bill condon s god and monster is a fascinating look into the last day in the life of gay director james whale ian mckellan who made the horror classic frankenstein and bride of frankenstein since i wa unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film there is no way to know how accurate the film is but i suspect that much of it only came from whale s inner fantasy and hallucination whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror picture decided fifteen year before his death at age to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him a the film tell it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who wa working a the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly wa what many people refer to him a in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scene a young film enthusiast visit whale s home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answer the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale want when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesn t really think much of this much to the warning of his friend becoming more and more intrigued in the story whale tell him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale start to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life a he begin to seldom suffer mild stroke and moment of true catharsis god and monster is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who wa forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to a a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and find that many of the other attendee do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whale s first love in his life wa making movie and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life a played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale come off a a sad but dignified man and a person who wa not afraid to stand out from others just a long a he knew he wa being true to himself he never hid the fact that he wa gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it wa this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only thing of whale a a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it mean so much more to whale who see boone a sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a dead end job a a gardener of people s home whale view him a the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begin his feeling but one that will actually listen to him since whale life with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small element hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film doe not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story development but it is a little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two character are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two a the tension slowly build in lesser hand this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that help the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film wa not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether god and monster is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also play a a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from god and monster it wa ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one else s business in the first place | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned james toback s return to directing after a eight year layoff two girl and a guy is a film which is comprised more or less of just that one guy blake robert downey jr two girl carla heather graham and lou natasha gregson wagner one primary setting blake s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment and a great deal of dialogue embracing a near real time approach this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hang upon the performance of it three actor and the quality of the dialogue written by mr toback for his bantering character fortunately the film s cast is up to the challenge and the wordy exchange between the triad of character while admittedly variable are occasionally wickedly amusing the film s setup is fairly generic in nature and open rather unpromisingly we meet self possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou both waiting outside a soho loft a they engage in idle chatter it is revealed that they re both waiting for their respective boyfriend to return from the airport and it doesn t take long for them to come to the realisation that they re being two timed by the same guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation it s when blake return to his abode where the film hit it stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that burst onto the scene and raise the stake to new height it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the film s best choice wa to have his two girlfriend scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing u to size up blake not with his interaction with others but by his own innate behaviour whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving message to his beloved carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the spark begin to fly one of the great touch in the film is how blake when startled by carla s unannounced appearance begin to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag double teamed by the understandably aggrieved woman who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declaration against their verbal jab surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by it trio of character two girl and a guy concludes it first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing wa off limit for this film however it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length and it s a the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundity on the nature of fidelity and relationship that it slowly but surely begin to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film s tempo loses it liveliness the dynamic between the character evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequence fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusion are made a poster of jules et jim hang prominently on the wall and secret are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girl and a guy wa embroiled in a bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regard to this scene contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film mr toback wa forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down version of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girl and a guy serf a a showcase for the phenomenal talent of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he play the gamut from indignant to humbled from self assured to disconcerted yet his acting gear shift so smoothly a to not be registered it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four day shortly after mr downey jr wa arrested on drug charge and it s hard not to see echo of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blake s self chiding to get his shit together is disquieting in it resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actress are solid in more broadly observed role m graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actress involving herself in three successive risky project two girl and a guy and boogie night are both quite sexually frank while lost in space ha a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman she s quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile m gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audience are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tone it down substantially a the film progress but i found her more fun to watch a the artificially excitable chatterbox the film wa reportedly shot in eleven day filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifact of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girl and a guy ha an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one sens that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actor while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesn t feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his character in an effective manner two girl and a guy fall short of it potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr it s still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly a we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the table on his girlfriend i m an actor he tell them at one point using the ol tried and tested occupational hazard defense actor lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington | Predicció: 1,

      "Opinió: i actually am a fan of the original or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mill twice a a pair of twin separated at birth by divorcing parent never to come in contact with the other so the parent never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remake especially of film i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake wa not originally on the top of my viewing list and wa actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney film are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it s actually good not the original good but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit a it doe become entertaining for the same exact reason the original wa entertaining because it s cute and innocent fun because it ha a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parent are also immensely appealing and i m repeating myself because it s cute and innocent fun there s nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twin and denying them the truth for year is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it s aimed directly at either kid adult who want to remember the original or young adult who want to remember what it wa like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movie wasn t so weird or diverse the name godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple year to see abc s wonderful world of disney where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friend and their mother to see all the rereleased disney film like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of child s animated half hour show made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldn t dare missing i can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap it s more of a late childhood movie because it deal with the issue of divorce but it deal with it in a disney ized version it s playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood i d probably dismiss it i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it wa to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibility of my seemingly perfect parent splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situation thing could always work out if you well manipulate thing a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it s also charming in it own way it ha a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick a tone that isn t corny or condescending but just right the moment that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kid actually know better than the foolish adult the story is basically classic by now repeated almost a many time a kurosawa s the seven samurai a pair of twin played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mill in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parent one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she life with her parent and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz a she work a a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sport and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie want to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which result in some nasty prank which wind them in seclusion together in a private out of the way cabin there they become friend then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch place so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother s life in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer come they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mill in the original but she come off just a appealing a she did once she doe though add a couple new thing she make the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also add on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake one accent aren t exactly perfect she s also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actor are especially in their first film she make a great protagonist and it only help that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn t been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what ha made him a notable actor in the past not just that he s mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning a maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film add another dimension and another angle to their character that wa amiss in the original during the opening credit we see glimpse from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film s more smarmy scene come off a actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way a in many such film this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since well the original film year ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it ha a form of intelligence and wit that make such plot point a an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who s deliciously tormented by the twin later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it take two starring the olsen twin because it treat the child a the smart one and the adult a the silly one not the other way around and because above everything it know exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scene work well but not nearly a well a they worked in the original i liked the way the parent fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flame getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawk cary grant film of yesteryear and a much a this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty wa far more stylized and just a suitable for adult audience a it wa for young audience a such this remake may never be nearly a great or classic a the original film but it at least know how to treat it source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effect without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyance | Predicció: 0, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: it s terribly unfortunate that stir of echo tautly written and directed by david koepp who made one of s unsung treasure the trigger effect should be released little more than a month after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two film are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience member last night and although they have eerily similar storyline stir of echo is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly ha been one of the major factor in it recent repeat business stir of echo is more conventional and predictable in it final twist and where the sixth sense wa disturbing stir of echo is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewer are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarity and will foolishly forget to judge this film on it own respectable merit adapted from a novel by richard matheson that wa written some forty year ago stir of echo open with a cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks doe it hurt to be dead apparently jake see the ghost of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn t the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom ha just discovered she is six week pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at a party with their closest friend tom convinces maggie s new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly work and before long tom is seeing thing he wouldn t normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six month seeking help from lisa she tell him that while he wa under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn t expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he see stir of echo isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in it portrayal of a struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe s dream with the fish are top notch and exceedingly believable a a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problem after tom is hypnotized and start seeing ghastly vision he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he ha seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead belief what tom say and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through doe not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood star like tom cruise and julia robert and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible a a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their job just to make end meet in a masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he see starting from his view a he close his eye into darkness lisa tell him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we a audience member are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen a a fuzzy word in black letter pop up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene a mesmerizing and brilliantly construed a this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wake up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he ha just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having load of fun with her small role a maggie s sister lisa illeana douglas s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature film funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas get to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom s vision of the girl she remark i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she s dead give one pause also of note are jenny morrison s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in s whatever a morrison s grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echo doe not live up to it obviously frightful full potential and it doesn t what come before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whisper and ghostly sound effect successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp prof once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situation that revolve

unfortunately for the devil s advocate this ending nearly collapse in on itself and ruin the entire film nevertheless the film doe provide two and a half hour of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever wa in charge of the preview for this film i don t think i wa quite prepared for this movie because the trailer made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it doe contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ad is the other plot element and seemingly more interesting one at that the devil s advocate begin in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reef is the defense attorney working for a client whom ha been accused of raping a young girl he end up with a not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaf the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he fly to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting jury and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john milton al pacino asks him to work permanently a a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost a a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begin to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begin to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann take up a friendship with a neighbor who always give advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hour upon hour with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while thing turn completely upside down a kevin s wife claim to have seen monstrous image superimposed on her friend a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin s real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john milton really satan playing trick with kevin s life the devil s advocate play out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriter wanted to surprise everyone by giving u something we don t expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make u feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devil s advocate mess up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending a is now than i would have if it had ended ten minute early i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i wa settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what wa the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didn t like the ending the producer of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just a it is ending they pull the rug out from under you film like seen and the usual suspect can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devil s advocate on the other hand end unpredictably not from u knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again a for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hour being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film run like a well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which doe not occur it wa at this point that i felt cheated taking u on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around a he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which make most of the film seem like a game i don t want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned it r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn t subtle about anything showing u everything it actually surprise me that this film did not receive an nc rating a it is quite harsh however the movie doe have it merit and nudity and sex are among those i don t condone sex and nudity in film but if it there i might a well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontation between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stand out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann s problem are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reason other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually ha something to say about humanity in one of the last scene john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god play with his child he is satan of course he comment that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god set up rule which contradict human nature this semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton say is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it wa funny but patially realizing it wa true these moral dilemma are present throughout the devil s advocate giving it an added depth many film skip over in their writing but i m sure they came straight from the novel it wa based on when a film ha something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlight a we see memorable face and they put spin on those memorable face we don t expect heather matarazzo make a brief appearance a the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she doe a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reef he ha proven himself an uneven actor success such a speed and bomb such a johnny mnemonic but he top himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witch of eastwick and max von sydow needful thing he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scene but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known a the principal in ferris bueller s day off also give a good performance a eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance a the mother who hold a secret to kevin s past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several time one familiar face with a twist wa coach star craig t nelson who give a very good performance the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minute this film move along fairly quickly for the first two hour i sat completely engaged in the good performance and strong character the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effect and a good musical score director taylor hackford ha managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minute i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minute early | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various film mixed into an entirely different film however the edge ha done something that most action film should do and that is add heart and character we like to the plot in doing so the edge draw many more suspenseful moment out of cliched scene than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moment we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprise to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the gut to add it to his script action film are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining u they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror film have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild wa one of the best action suspense film i have seen from the s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic character is nearly unmatched to this day the edge ha the intelligence and smart character but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it wa very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliche and plot hole this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around a in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minute intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survival of the fittest film but taking scream s lead the edge make fun of the genre s cliche and then us them though not quite a effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonder what the accumulation of all this knowledge ha brought to him for once we don t immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take picture of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob a action film go these item do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob want to find a native to shoot picture of because of his personality charles bob bob s assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and a shown in the preview hit a flock of bird flying south for the winter down the plane go the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore ha to create original way to approach the situation he succeeds often enough for u to enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this ha been done many time in film with different animal and even bear but given the charles intelligence and bob s uncertainty many of the cliche are given fresh twist even charles himself seems to have seen these action film before my favorite line of the film come from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t a it seems anymore i have to write cautiously a to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first two third of the edge have many humorous moment to push it along and some of charles survival technique seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the character lose all sensibility i have always wondered why character in film walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear make your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the character and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical detail are awkward such a the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needle the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and border on phenomenal anthony hopkins give a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his role but here he exceeds at gaining the audience sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lamb alec baldwin give one of his best performance i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer elle macpherson give a good performance albeit slight she isn t in the film all that much but for the scene she doe have she handle a an actress not a a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scene are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of u are used to but too many cliche bog it down director tamahori ha created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled part david mamet s script though ha a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high strung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",
      "Opinió: one of the more unusual and suggestively violent film ever made seen is just a few step away from brilliance however those few step away are only a few step from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discus the film received mixed review upon release but there s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critic perhaps did not notice at time it get preachy about the horror it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent the shocking conclusion is just a unpredictable a the ending of most film are predictable this piece of work is intensity it s uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i can not turn away the story creep along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he ha experience in tantalizing his audience with information and vision but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien seen is even more ominous because the threat is real it s human and while the script take some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer work here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credit i ve ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development take place morgan freeman star a detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt co star a detective david mill the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guy these two fine actor give the film it human quality along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who play tracy mill wife however none of them stand out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actor could have played these part and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset ha only a week or that s seven day left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sin a chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sin in order of how each victim wa found it s the last two sin that are the most intriguing and shocking but i won t give that away a i said this ha a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer set out to make a statement to the world that these sin will no longer be tolerated and he make the sinner suffer for it the two partner stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he wa murdered forced to eat himself to death the killer leaf small clue at this and other murder and of course somerset and mill are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didn t it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but it s not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown like most of the violence in pulp fiction seen is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is post death still if you tend to get queasy don t eat food during this film kevin spacey play john doe the avenging angel who claim that he s the messenger who will right the wrong with his teaching like many crazy men he ha some fine idea but some sick way of expressing himself spacey doesn t appear until the final minute and also doesn t receive billing in the opening credit however it s his appearance that turn this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that it s hard to disagree when he say that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer ha ever been so creative seen is blatantly unsubtle with it message about the horror of the world and it s often a little too depressing what it lack in those area it make up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twist and realistic character the technical aspect of the film are unobtrusive fincher us lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we don t find out what happens to mill and somerset after the closing credit which are run backwards up the screen it s better to imagine what path they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget it s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing the evil of the world aren t going to cure themselves seen raise some tough question and it s intelligent enough to allow it audience to answer many of those question for themselves useless trivia co star in s seen brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best

      "Opinió: there are some work of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpiece is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one it popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remake that were made in more than half a century since it premiere but also in countless tribute and reference that movie maker use in their work to this day casablanca is also a movie that ha the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critic and loved by general audience one of the thing that make this film even more unique wa the fact that it wa doomed to fail at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of it time it wa based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn t been produced on stage screenplay by three writer julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch wa beeing written a shooting went along the main actor were producer second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz wa considered to be capable but not great director however the movie wa commercially successful and earned three oscar including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in it own golden age the plot of the movie wa heavily influenced by the need of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstance of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in december casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousand of refugee from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visa many shady character thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rain his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and life by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything change when he get in possession of two precious extra visa this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugee to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three time from nazi concentration camp and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple need visa especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actor who elevated his persona to the star status bogart s portrayal of rick a complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present wa so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbol of that era of filmmaking some happier time when the romance on the screen didn t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary work for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn t the romance itself it s the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choice in their life the casting of casablanca wa right on target not just in a case of main lead the supporting actor also did a marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john huston s maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original character another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid a the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo ha believable charisma and look like a somebody who could inspire million of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaf little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rain in a role of a lifetime wa embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rain managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rain also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movie to death discovered sign of homosexuality in renault s relationship towards rick and rick s final word leave room for even more outrageous speculation together with well drawn character and exciting story the movie wa good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpicker would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracy but casablanca is still a shining

      "Opinió: not too many people know who james whale is but it s a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movie if we are to believe the semi biographical god and monster whale would have wanted it to be that way this is an insightful haunting exploration of the last day of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay character in a hollywood movie god and monster ha no interest in being a biopic of whale s life because it track only the final few day of his life and it s probably a better movie for it it s focus is on whale s ian mckellen untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone brendan fraser it begin with whale a fairly talented artist aside from being a director asking boone to sit for him pose for a portrait at first boone doesn t realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man when he doe discover whale s sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid lynn redgrave he is frightened refusing to sit for the guy but he come back only to storm out again disgusted with whale s locker room talk boone return yet another time after whale promise to tone down the aforementioned locker room talk and find their platonic relationship to be strengthening meanwhile jimmy himself is suffering from hallucination and mental attack a a result of his stroke not long ago his ailment lead to desperation and depression which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor what is perhaps most sensational about god and monster is brendan fraser s bravura performance up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movie he is in blast from the past for example i wa surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here this is impressive because his character s dialogue is minimal with mckellan doing most of the talking that requires fraser to act through body language a difficult skill to master but something he prof capable of doing well this is not to ignore mckellan s oscar nominated turn he earned that nomination with his touching performance here although at the risk of sounding like a philistine i would have chosen his performance a the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination an understated compelling gem whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield he rejoiced in being free from it only reluctantly going to reception with fellow movie people in the end perhaps it is what killed him the memory of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare eugene novikov | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",
      "Opinió: when i initially set out to review this film my tag line wa going to be you too can believe whale can fly then it wa going to be you too can believe pastel triangle can fly then it wa going to be you too can believe wood sprite can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say there s a lot of flying going on in this film a our first host steve martin tell u the original concept behind fantasia wa to bring it out every year with some old segment retained and some new segment added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty year have passed since the original classic wa released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it wa first released in grossing somewhere close to in it original month of release subsequent re release of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it ha finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six story high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st to april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theater across the u after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theater is the format effective for the film with a few exception yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangle flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little thing until the ground erupts with swarm of evil black bat like triangle that attack and engulf their lighter counterpart eventually shaft of light from above help drive away the evil bat like thing and peace return to the butterfly thing though this segment isn t very story driven some of the image are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat thing who are all outlined in blood red color begin to overtake the sky the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s the pine of rome in this segment some humpback whale swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive iceberg that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf get into a scuffle with some nearby bird during the flight and end up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smash into while trying to avoid the bird attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brother take to the sky and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the ocean of cloud again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whale are involved reportedly the whale a viewed on an imax screen in certain sequence are shown a actual size the cgi whale look incredibly life like except for some googly cartoon eye drawn onto the image one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whale being cast through the wall of an iceberg a the whale calf try to find a way out to it parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segment is set to george gershwin s rhapsody in blue this segment is designed a a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different story about sad soul living in depression era new york there s a construction worker who dream of being a jazz drummer an out of work sad sack that dream of having a job a young girl that dream of spending time with her parent instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dream of being free from his overbearing wife i won t go into how everything work out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drag quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segment segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s piano concerto no and is an animated version of han christian andersen s the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier fall in love with a wind up clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester the jester knock the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little doe the jester know the soldier ha been deposited in the sewer and ha journeyed through the pipeline only to be swallowed by a fish that ha been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldier that the one legged one come from the soldier eventually save the day and get the girl although the ending ha been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some child may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saint saens the carnival of the animal this segment feature a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingo with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligator and hippo dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and it s the one that people remember most the sorcerer s apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film considering it wa shot full frame and exhibit large amount of grain there were at least two occasion where image were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problem crop up on modern day release when projected on screen too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theater segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck star a an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animal onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventure mainly involving donald being crushed by animal in various manner despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it display more emotion in it final scene than many of the tear jerker foisted on audience these day powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky s the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape tree bloom and flower blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rear back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in it path including everything that the sprite ha worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollar a ticket alone although brush stroke are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segment are largely no pun intended throwaway although steve martin s clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credit for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gag seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment come from of all people bette midler who get to tell u about some of the abandoned segment that never made it off of the drawing board piece like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horseman set to wagner s ride of the valkyrie and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never wa shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installment for fan of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material a i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollar seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after it run in imax theater it is going to be brought out in regular theater i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whale triangle thing sprite can fly g | Predicció:

      "Opinió: it s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x doe it and for that i commend it it not only take ball but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their life to hating anyone who s not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pull it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind follower that make up most skinhead member since he is the leader of the pack he s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that make eerie sense when he speaks he s so utterly convincing a a public speaker and so firm in his conviction that it come a a shock when he actually go through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he s almost a convincing and arresting a public speaker a say malcom x when we first see him he s clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and he s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxer and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullet at least when he doesn t need them he so belief in his conviction that he s willing to put his belief to the test even if he know it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple year american history x is about derek how he became a neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he wa rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that wa less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stage a a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who try to correct what he s done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all side or at least that s the intention the film s framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brook who i just found out wa or is the captain on star trek s deep space is trying to correct him when the film open danny ha just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which cause him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it ha gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he s cleaned up not a buff and ha a full head of hair he s just a intelligent but still very rough along the edge but he s wisened up he s no longer controlled by his anger at black and jew and try to persuade danny who s becoming what derek wa before to give up his lifestyle but danny won t he go to a large skinhead beer bash meet with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is a opposed to neo nazi dom a he wa for it a couple of year ago the film circle around this then spin off into non linear flashback all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime a a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raid on local store that no longer hire the white middle class teenager since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrant to do the same work and mouthing off his theory on affirmative action and how illegal immigrant and black have destroyed the fundamental this country wa built on to them the white man is the one who ha gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he back everything up with political reason justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he say sound true american history x is a collection of really great scene and moment rather than a cohesive great film that flow effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scene i ve seen all year one scene feature a dinner between derek s family and his mother s newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek s rightist view launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that build unparalled emotion in the audience gould s reaction to derek s final summation is unnerrving another scene us humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co worker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soon to be classic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that wind derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there s much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with stand out coming from avery brook beverly d angelo a the long suffering mother and gould who ha one horrible line but other than that come off with the best performance he s given in what seems like a really long time norton walk off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton ha invented himself a one of the most reliable and intense actor of his generation and maybe the best there s nothing like it when norton really get rolling in this movie spewing out line with such authority that he command all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allows the little emotion to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isn t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hope to be it s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off a either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movie tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinhead are reduced to mere cliche kevin smith regular ethan suplee fair rather annoyingly a the fat skinhead whose line consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isn t a well travelled furlong s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashback refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which wa inevitable it doesn t seem like it ha actually arrived there even derek s descent into skinhead dom doesn t seem justified though his fireman father william rus the dad from boy meet world and don t ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his belief a such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history x is a very good movie and i wa very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut a it is is not up to what he claim to be his potential somewhere he claim there lie a tony kaye cut and that wa to be the true cut until it wa viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by it director it wasn t allowed to him under the ground that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really that s the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kaye s right in that it s not up to par even if he s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be a do the right thing for the late s yet it still get it point across intelligently and back it up with it story it message that one can not be so enwrapped in one s own belief or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isn t perfect at least when avery brook turn to norton after he ha been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he s done ha made his life any better it realy hit a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: star war episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movie evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star war the original blockbuster film and it two sequel not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but ha deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more american today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so year after the release of the original and year since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star war film withstand the weight of incomparable expectation and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of character possibly compete with the legend of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icon against this challenge the fourth star war film episode one the phantom menace hit the screen last week and despite some early critical review in the major medium the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star war film the phantom menace take place decade before the setting of original film a the film open obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star war is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinni liam neeson the republic government ha sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that ha developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiation but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the part they need but display uncanny intelligence insight and instinct qui gon sens the child is unusually strong with the force and begin to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force a anyone who ha watched the original star war trilogy know far from being a galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matter further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sound a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of character and an immediate crisis but set up the foundation for the event that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knight anakin s turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story move quickly with the only drawback being that many question predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reason the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it s unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movie were clearly luke s story with the story centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s if this trilogy is centered on anakin it s a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actor lack the subtle acting skill of adult performer and a a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast doe fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect a an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast a obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fit the role of a young queen well but her line were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the character but the interaction between them individually the character in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star war and the storyline is not more confusing than previous film in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn t do a good of a job playing the character off one another in star war there were immediate contrast and memorable exchange between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitude and personality in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four character in the way they react to the immediate problem and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the character and their relationship with each other individually they are interesting character with clear motivation and interest but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it ha disappointed many reviewer but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful element of lucas previous film make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the character visit magical underwater city evade dinosaur sized sea monster fight battle droids and menacing destroyer on venetian looking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settle for vague idea about the look of his setting he creates rich spectacular landscape palace and skyline most of the new special effect in his re released special edition trilogy in were change that allowed him to give the earlier movie the look and feel that just weren t possible when the film were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creature robot with personality and a supporting cast of alien who interact with the main character the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother a slave watto ha a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wing that flutter like a hummingbird a he float around the room of all the computer generated character in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated character no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minute of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumble his way into the path of the jedi knight early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film lightening scene with his mishap and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the character throughout the film a if he were really on the set with the actor however despite the technological magic that make his character possible jar jar isn t completely convincing he still move and sound too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he s there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar wa a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star war movie is that the film is replete with humor and small detail that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film s struggle between good and evil and the sober musing about one s destiny and the force like all star war film the phantom menace never take itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his film are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lot of half hidden joke and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace work because a in all his film there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battle hair raising chase and thrilling duel between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scene in any star war film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas ha filmed the phantom menace won t win any major oscar it probably won t beat titanic s box office record and it s not even the best star war film i d put it third after the original and the empire strike back but it s an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can t live up to it s hype no film not even the original star war could have done that but it s

      "Opinió: cinematically speaking gordon park original is not a great film a bit slow at time and more than a little rough around the edge a it build to it climactic explosion of violent action this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman s black private dick that s a sex machine to all the chick to the big screen hardly qualifies a groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly year after it original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the film s connection with moviegoer far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stem from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his as this fact also explains why john singleton s yg revival of john shaft is a enjoyable a it is much like the film that started the franchise this s plot doesn t score point in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thriller contrary to what ha been reported over the past few month this is not a remake of the original film but more of a sequel spinoff the star audience know and love from the original film and it first two sequel s and s richard roundtree once again play john shaft who still run a private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lie on his same named nephew samuel l jackson who a the film begin is a cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaf him at odds with his superior when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaf the force and decides to take matter into his own hand a a p i but that s easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is people hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime people or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson s way toward commanding this film people is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stage however he isn t so funny a to make the character come off a goofy and buffoonish and people eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that s exactly what wright doe and make it seem effortless then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson s impressive star turn doesn t quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co star bale ha already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in so it only follows that his performance a a similar less exaggerated character would be spot on collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight a the frightened conflicted diane busta rhyme brings some good laugh a shaft s sidekick rasaan registering not a strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams a tough narcotic cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also ha little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credit aside his shaft doesn t even have one sex scene that singleton once again prof his ability with actor is an especially good thing since he s not really an action director this is not to say that he doe a bad job with the numerous gunfight and the requisite foot and car chase they move well a doe the film a a whole and are reasonably exciting it s just that there s nothing terribly inventive about them these set piece are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional but if there s anything that a movie doe well it s make the familiar look cool and this keep that tradition alive from the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkle throughout the film on the film look great and easily sweep the viewer into it world with it energetic bravado even a common visual trick such a employing fancy wipe for scene transition not only feel unforced it feel necessary style doesn t exactly make for a

kiki isn t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training a a witch her mother is also a witch and a thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parent treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audience but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki s mother act a a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she ha been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she s discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skill a a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she us her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossom into her working a a courier a one person delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn t seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of fault and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one ha something about them some interest or trait that make them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizen is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely look impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern need of the s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozen are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i won t suffice it to say that many of these minor detail could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorite are kiki s relationship with the baker s husband although he s quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scare her his kindness win her friendship in the garage of a deliveree s house can be found a vintage model t two old lady have a relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such detail give the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crash down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this cause kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki come to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don t even want to hint at it the ending of the movie ha a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment i ve ever seen if you don t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steer free of many of the disney convention there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny line and scene however i would be surprised if disney doesn t give jiji more joke or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted a habit disney movie have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty wa derived from a person s inside and wa then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desire for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movie is in the style of animation for kiki s delivery service not a colorful and dynamic a disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fit the movie to a t this is particularly true with scene of kiki s flight the extreme realism of the bird in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and help these scene capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i ve ever seen i m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united state disney tentatively plan a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli film after that i d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak season with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it s good to know that it s being released at all for kiki s delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bite dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie i ve ever seen | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: i like movie with albert brook and i really like movie directed and written by albert brook lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedy his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movie today inundated a we are with film which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brook film while the dialog will not be a oppressive a in some of the independent talk film which are finding their way into theater the situation in which his character find themselves are one we can often identify with but even if we can t brook ha the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenager and jim carrey fan probably won t find an albert brook movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brook comedy is intelligent mother is albert brook latest film and it doe not disappoint brook play john henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he make an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then ha dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sport agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff ha a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witness a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hint at a fault in john and his career every time she talk with him and john give it right back to her at the end of one of their conversation where beatrice ha just picked apart john s life she say i love you and john reply with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticism but instead give them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it s the kind that go something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems a though nothing he doe make her happy there s always the big but john belief that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationship with woman either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out woman who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he come to the conclusion that since his problem are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kind of feeling come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he call it brook own brand of humor really shine in this film especially in the interaction john ha with his mother there s a scene where john ha just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel she still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glance at the life his mother lead when she try to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buy in great quantity and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john point out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tell him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he s also surprised at the variety of item beatrice keep in the refrigerator such a a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer wa a good invention say john but it s not supposed to be used for everything that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator it s something most of u find strangely familiar brook is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep s character are in a comedy club having a discussion when they re finished and walk out brook cut to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don t know what the joke wa because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minute it seemed so out of context in this film brook us the same trick a couple of time to open or close a scene i don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just a well a they have in the past john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we a the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but a john spends more time with her we learn thing about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit a enjoyable a the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brook doe an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often belief he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way he s very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds a beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character this only help the audience to share the frustration john feel when dealing with her a his first choice brook originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who wa beginning to show symptom of alzheimer s disease that may be just a well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also doe a good job at playing the younger brother who ha always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed a a mama s boy the only thing that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot hole a solid connection is not really made between john s trouble and his reason for living with his mother additionally the end result of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goal and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think i m some kind of moron john no i think your someone who think i m a moron beatrice well it take one to know one | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: martin scorsese s film used to intimidate me because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them a deep film art rather than a great flick a much a i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something i learned from scorsese s casino that whatever technique he us are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movie for example in casino he us subtitle when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code word with each other there wa no meaning more exotic than that subtitle were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what wa really going on or toward the end when he us three quick dissolve to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing i don t mean to say that his technique are not creative or good looking but he simply us the best tool for the job it shouldn t have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie s title is another name for the dalai lama which mean ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic vision to embellish the literal story one of which make an interesting statement pay attention to the film s opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two year old his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lama who have gone before several item belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other item the child is asked if he recognizes any of the item a his own the boy pick correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child wa taking his cue from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetan were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised a the reincarnation of the lama s spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be ground for a call to social service but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keep him from becoming a genuinely likeable well rounded person certain pattern take shape over the year for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radio clock and telescope are some of his favorite toy when he is old enough to accept his leadership he make plan to modernize isolated tibet he also ha a soft spot for creature who are suffering or in pain including herd animal it s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet s gigantic neighbor china tibet and it leader prove correct in fearing china a first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the army come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama s life is in danger if he stay the movie end when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaf tibet for india the story doesn t lead up to a cinematic climax a strongly a most feature film do it just doesn t fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven year in tibet which is good in it own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the character and event not vice versa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestment and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant color is shown throughout the movie the robe and hat of state are bright red and gold the brick are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetan even the touchstone picture logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he wa the perfect choice for those who don t know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building block are lot of small note tiny grain of music which are first grouped then repeated in pattern these pattern create interesting texture which are themselves part of a larger composition people won t be flocking to kundun for it s great ending or talking about it outstanding plot but it doe have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sight rich cinematography and innovative music it give interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and take a warm look at the dalai lama a a person on top of it all

      "Opinió: i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x file first let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie the producer are not stupid making a movie just for fan of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fan will only fail to understand certain emotion behind the look many character exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel a if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the x file i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network a been so kind a to air several key episode for several week before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episode and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoiler follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the x file is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effect unlike other summer movie the effect do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performance this is coming from a guy who think david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie doe not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movie the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our hero in fact the first time the critter in this movie make an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might a well bring ear plug because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much wa when i first saw alien a a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your foot on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x file is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination work overtime and it sure beat having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it look like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the x file is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minute total no the x file is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson get maybe half the screen time she ha a couple of good scene with duchovny but she get kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she doe not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder shower independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent event mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who care if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our hero so we feel a if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i can not stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movie the dialogue is twice a important a the effect miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movie you will go home and tell all your friend how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movie don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scene because again unlike most summer movie godzilla anybody the x file doe not need to fill scene between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serf a purpose who need to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attack so far this summer i have seen only one movie who rank higher on my list of movie i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only win by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x file is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effect it s got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fan of the series will hate this movie while non fan will have a good time it doe not provide answer to the show s many question the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five star for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrill many whoah i never saw that one coming moment four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five star so i had

      "Opinió: here is a film that is so unexpected so scary and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop okay it isn t quite original considering it is a sequel to the box office hit specie but it certainly is smart most film of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b horror film from the s and s and some even become them however a we learned with the small budget horror sci fi film sometimes expectation can be shattered a lot of criticism ha gone against this film from what i have read so far anyway yep all two review and it make me wonder why these type of film are automatically dismissed a gory laughable piece of trash but the thing is it isn t it s well made well acted and quite intelligent i can see most of the critic now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film but the specie series isn t about the lack of these element it s about how much it can get into one film and yet behind it all it ha this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so specie ii begin in the present day though it seems to be an alternate universe many film especially sci fi one create similar timeline a our realistic one but change it to fit the film s need specie ii begin with the arrival of an american spacecraft the excursion landing on the surface of mar aboard is patrick ross justin lazard a very bright and very handsome astronaut patrick is the son of senator ross james cromwell who just want patrick to succeed well it would seem that he ha succeeded landing on the surface of mar he is the first human being to ever do so of course he isn t the first ever about a billion year ago an alien specie supposedly landed on mar and destroyed the perfect living condition that were able to sustain life now of course the red planet is cold and rocky no life life on it that is no visible life patrick upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil collect sample from the ground he take them aboard and put them in storage unfortunately one of the sample contains a form of life and it get loose when it is heated aboard the ship just prior to heading back to earth this life form creep along the floor and inhabits the earthling they pas out for approximately seven minute and then shrug it off a nothing because they can t even remember they blame it on a technical malfunction back on earth patrick begin to have strong urge to mate with a many woman a possible a we know from the original this is because the alien want to breed and take over the planet however the child that are bred are half human a their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he find it in eve natasha henstridge eve wa cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urge have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from specie and her motif seem respectable since she wa involved with the original alien attack she want to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it ha story wise specie ii is much stronger than it predecessor but it is also much stronger than say alien hey i love the film but you can t tell me it wa strong on story what surprised me the most with this film wa the incorporation of historical fact into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mar which landed in one of the pole this piece of rock contained fossil which may have been proof of life on mar later it wa proven that it wa not a living creature that created it the script us this effectively but also manages to provide a well balanced plot beginning with the first man on mar something i have always dreamed of seeing i wa hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie and it doe it quite well the character are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he doe there are the obvious flaw of course mostly lying in the technical aspect the special effect are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mother gave birth to alien child also the most realistic one are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone s head being blown off however some plot element also may elicit laugh from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the specie series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however i tend to disagree what were the alien film about and if an alien specie ever did come to earth and their sole purpose wa to destroy u wouldn t you mate a quickly a possible with a many people a possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick go searching for a mate in a grocery store i didn t realize that alien were that picky on choosing woman to mate with i just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is a vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it wa bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it wa good it would have asked for comparison with film like alien okay so it isn t that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting a his over the top impersonation of a general make him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around a she is usually enclosed in a cage however she doe manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she s quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is so so but he isn t annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell ha a small part but he make it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor a i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increase in likeability mykelti williamson give an enjoyable performance and he give the film a more down to earth feel and of course justin lazard lazard ha so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective sure he is wooden but isn t that what his character is like the moment when he touch the glass separating henstridge from him wa extremely well done due to the couple s acting specie ii is rated r for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language this is definitely an r rated film that young kid should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmare and never have sex for the rest of their life hell i don t even know if i will what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turn out to be the surprise film of the year i probably won t see another film where i wa expecting so little and got so much for quite a while director peter medak ha crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series medak ha also mastered the wonderful jump moment and ha probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still ha the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a sure handed director specie ii is exactly what these film should be entertaining | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

in casualty of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy force shaw experience first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet graz his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train black in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldier who laid down their life to free their brother from slavery the film periodically jump between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldier the movie introduces u to a handful of black recruit and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying a a runaway slave with a big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he remove his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scar from his day a a slave it make your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear roll down washington s cheek and will probably run down your cheek a well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoe because his foot were covered with oozing sore freeman is a usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role he play a grave digger who ha buried more white soldier than he care to remember he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldier holding the group together and serving a a liaison to the white officer colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher make an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friend searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drill to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment the soldier suffer innumerable hardship but somehow they never lose their morale the army treat the black soldier like second class citizen subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only a month whereas their white counterpart earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoe gun or uniform to make matter worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the black into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives it boot uniform rifle and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw ha absolute faith in his soldier and he fight tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it mean threatening a general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scene where shaw stand up for the regiment unfortunately however broderick s uneven performance is in many respect the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sport a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slip in and out of a phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing a shaw since much of the time his emotion seem forced the film place too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldier who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with it harrowing depiction of war the movie show the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory doe not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and gut except for a few bullet wound and one exploding head the film for the most part leaf the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scene in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it s just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething film them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldier the movie depicts some of but not enough of their custom and ritual in one scene for example the soldier motivate themselves by singing prayer around the campfire each man ha a chance to relay a few word of inspiration a couple of the movie s most touching moment involve young black child looking up to the black soldier with awe disbelief and pride the regiment s greatest triumph come when the soldier distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peer and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory ha it share of gloom and despair but ultimately it prof to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history book say or more precisely what they do not say black played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

stature truman also recall an era of plenty following a grim war an era when planned community built by government scientist promised an idyllic life for american and burbank california brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or wa the center of tv s world the world where our protagonist life combine all these name and concept into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman lead the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality come under attack one day when a studio light fall from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jam and he start picking up a voice that exactly describes his movement he is so distracted that he nearly hit a pedestrian when the radio come back to normal the announcer warns listener to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddity the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and try to take the elevator the elevator door open up on a small lounge with people on coffee break a grip see truman him and quickly move a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guard grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it get even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it s best not to think about it she say trying vainly to change truman s memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program his action are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the all seeing creator of truman s world doe his best to keep him unaware and happy it s sort of like westworld told from the robot point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaur point of view we root for the captive of the cage world our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting question such a the ethic of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life ha all been fake although these question came to mind i don t think the film itself asked them it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them i wa particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didn t see it that way perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t but it seems like there were some missed opportunity here but on it own term the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scene are all apparently shot from hidden camera with snoot and obstruction covering the corner of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led number obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and scored the film open with what sound like family drama theme music when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie end the score sound more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates truman s scene of suspicion and awakening glass ha a small cameo a a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story wa brisk there wa no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title card a few interview and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scene is of the studio light falling there wa no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it fall apart because it wasn t necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it s a quick straight shot to the movie s end in term of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca both film are well made with interesting story set in interesting world but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great idea neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccol s next film whatever it may be | Predicció: 1, Real: 1\n",

      "Opinió: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minute of finn taylor s first feature film dream with the fish when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pay off with a potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectation however are soon vanquished a the film settle upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely a funny a it aspires to be nor nearly a affecting a it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half the film s central character are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claim to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick life in the apartment building across from terry who spy on the tryst between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeter upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch and eventually con terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pill of course terry find that the pill do not end up having the presumed lethal effect and he angrily set out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nick s condition he only ha a handful of week left terry s compassion kick in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasy and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him this is a promising premise and mr taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious way from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the character terry is a repessed mournful character who want to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but want to live and take the easy route out by turning dream with the fish into a typical lark where the two character engage in a series of generally dull exploit and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character this is by the number plotting buddy movie road movie redux however dream with the fish is most hampered not by it uninspired storyline but by the character which carry the story it help in such a film to have at least one of the protagonist be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the film s leading character are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plight and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploit far from a romp this fatal flaw make dream with fish more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempt at emotional resonance in the latter stage of the film a the two men begin to bond mr taylor s dialogue sporadically fall flat in dream with the fish while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often come across instead a hopelessly contrived witness such line a you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that s provocative leaf room for further question the film enjoys a few inspired moment the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip but unfortunatetely these instance are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fish register more a attempt rather than actual success this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence a terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital i m realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lip which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempt sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him this is not a film which ha the wherewithal to kill off it leading star in the opening ten minute the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempt at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering fresh faced character he would have been terrific a the lead for george huang s swimming with shark who get to apply his adeptness for timidity a terry mr taylor ambitiously employ an interesting visual technique where the portion of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated a opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scene the charge of dream with the fish s protagonist being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for film with unlikeable character and indeed in many case have i been in the minority supporting film which have been condemned a interminable due to the difficult audience unfriendly nature of their character for dream with the fish though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character

completely inept on all front it s a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man ha ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn t count is no fun at all end of day is a major stinker the movie open in vatican city some catholic priest have observed an ancient prophecy which say that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope order protection of this girl though some priest believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty year later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem now working a a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest lead him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing element of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priest looking to kill her there are so many problem with this film it s hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this wa a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold ha neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotion in other word trying to give him dimension wa a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed hero but not schwarzenegger there are several scene that attempt to establish jericho s character one ha him contemplating suicide another cry over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil try to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back none of these scene really work because arnie isn t up to the task the filmmaker would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the like of which schwarzenegger ha excelled in before this one isn t at all believable the way arnold play him the supporting cast try their hardest and only gabriel byrne make any impact at all a the prince of darkness he s suave and confident he act like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script ha him doing thing that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him a a powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it cause the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne s speech about the bible being overrated actually start to make sense mainly because arnold s attempt at refuting it mostly of the ti not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold ha to win so in the end nobody really care kevin pollack play jericho s security guard sidekick and try to liven thing up with some comic aside but like most bad action movie sidekick he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting player are good actor but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performance aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which start off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it s utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year s eve because it s exactly year after the year of the devil which isn t it turn out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add a to the beginning and you ve got if you don t buy this explanation you re not alone it s convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she s christine see and she life in new york see and if that weren t bad enough there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all why can satan kill everyone he pass on the street but when it come to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he s powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can t control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monk deal with time zone in their prophecy a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but it s never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean don t get me started on the time paradox offered up by the terminator movie but this time the plot inconsistency stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of day complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat wa doing in there it get so formulaic that it s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eye at the precise moment a boo will come their prediction will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequence are utterly charmless partially because we don t care about these character due to the script s pathetic attempt at characterization and setup and also because they too don t make any sense there s a scene where schwarzenegger get thrown around a room by a little old lady it s good for a few chuckle but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now ha super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never set that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequence are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of day is not only silly and confusing but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also mean that not a single scene in end of day go by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience go numb scene aren t connected through any reasonable mean so a lot of the time stuff get blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reason to hell with reason let s just blow stuff up isn t it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it s dull interminable and unrelenting in it stupidity perhaps arnold need to make some movie with james cameron to revive his career because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here end of day might have had camp value if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmaker should have come up with a decent script if it s going to be campy arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously i didn t actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack a it stand end of day is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

      "Opinió: when the haunting arrived in theater all i kept hearing about wa the overdone special effect and the fact that very often the unseen bump in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effect while i agree that this remake of the haunting go a bit overboard in the visual effect department i don t think that they are completely to blame for this movie s failure it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the unseen terror and it wa about a scary a a dust bunny so special effect or not if the story isn t the least bit scary you aren t going to end up with a very frightening movie the thing that interested me most about this movie wa the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern dern is always great and even though he may have had only about minute of screen time he wa still the most interesting element of the movie a i sat through the seemingly endless albeit fairly impressive special effect i kept wishing that this movie wa about dern s caretaker and not the one dimensional character that populated the cast never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie liam neeson play a scientist who is conducting experiment on fear he decides the best way to get result is to trick a group of fairly unstable individual to spend a few day in a haunted mansion he trick them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia and he also fails to mention that the mansion ha a reputation for strange going on catherine zeta jones lili taylor and owen wilson play his subject like the original taylor s character is the star of the movie but since she doesn t quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and m zeta jones their part did seem to be a big larger than in the original and let s face it probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta jones i ll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren t in it but the real star here is the special effect combined with the fairly overdone set they take over the movie a the supernatural element of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patient there really isn t much of a story here just endless setup so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effect that he got to play with and the special effect are great in many case they are a good a you are likely to see anywhere in other case they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the cool shot quota at no point in the movie do any of these thing ever come close to being scary funny maybe but not scary then we have the set when i first saw the house i wa very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it but it only took a short tour by the character around the place to see that the set designer obviously had a much money to burn a the visual effect people did and decided to take the idiotically overdone route this included a flooded hallway with book a stepping stone and a mirrored circular room that revolves what part did these room play in the story absolutely none they were just there to take our mind off the fact that there wa neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie then we have the actor lili taylor ha never been one of my favorite and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in she come in around the average or slightly below mark i have no idea why liam neeson took this role he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus his character wa in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all print of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copy of darkman zeta jones wa cast because she is too hot for word the fact that her character is bi sexual is just icing on the cake all catherine ha to do in this movie is look good fortunately that is something she doe very well while she doe have a fairly good size part it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie wa a eye candy it s too bad someone of her talent wasted them here any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role the haunting is the antithesis of another of s horror movie the blair witch project the haunting had a seemingly limitless effect budget while blair witch relies on pile of rock for it scare both prove quite nicely that special effect are irrelevant to a horror film if the story suck it s all downhill from there my advice if you are looking for special effect go rent star war if it s scare you want rent halloween either way it s probably in your best interest to skip the haunting | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

when i see a pair of second or third rate celebrity engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award it s not my fault i know it s not my fault but dammit someone s got ta be embarrassed because it doesn t look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame i m about to give you a list of name of people who are gon na make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these name make you instantly shudder the answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individual we ve got here granted john goodman wa in the flintstone and greg kinnear ha turned in some less than lackluster leading man performance in certified failure like a smile like yours but even so they ve got proven power a excellent supporting player garry shandling ha two television classic under his belt his ingenious little it s garry shandling s show and the larry sander show and for god s sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purport to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and woman satirizing the whole pop psychology mar venus phenomenon but what this movie wind up being is a collection of unfunny cringe inducing moment coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moment the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringe inducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling play an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant male they reproduce through cloning of course his leader put a select group of male through a series of test designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the specie and impregnate her they re taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying uh huh and how to compliment shoe imagine my delighted surprise when oh heaven all their carefully practiced tactic turn out to fail miserably producing comedic result the lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generation of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population ha stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clone whoop too late the penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise the writer when frequently strapped for idea tend to turn to this a a source of comedy it isn t funny the first time it isn t funny the eighth time it isn t funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely self conscious garry meet up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turn out to be a generic unlikable scumbag he s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling s alien character but he s so flatly drawn that even the writer quickly give up and toss him aside kinnear s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claim other people work a his own to worm his way into a vice president position and go to aa meeting to pick up chick wow what a magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played a the same sort of sex driven slimeball when kinnear s wife walk into the office there isn t a single guy who doesn t trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall a if they d never seen a woman before the few guy that aren t particularly slimeballs such a john goodman s detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholic shandling meet up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnear s aa meeting shandling s mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desire to her bening instantly fall for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turn out she want a baby too bening s character perhaps wa the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seam so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the specie a a whole then woe i say to the specie she s unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandling s line and lie that it border on tragic there s a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear child she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry come home after nearly cheating on her she stroll into the kitchen and sings high hope you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then say to him now you can t leave me we re supposed to empathize with shandling s discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she wa placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing and eventually shandling fall in love with her for real i suppose though i m not sure exactly what prompted it what s the message i derive from all this men are liar inherently empty creature but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha i m thankful such broad cynicism isn t frequently allowed to run so rampant let s all join hand and pray that the planet these folk are from is not this one there s also a subplot involving john goodman a an airline incident investigator that wade in the bog of stupidity goodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realization put together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis it ha all the making for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never come to the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and fall away further proof that goodman should just stick

designed i m sure to mirror the actual skull bone from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlight the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he find himself surrounded by beautiful woman driving a new car and marveling at the that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstance become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe a a drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offer it share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately the skull is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it s just another abysmal teen prototype that ha the soundtrack the star but not the script the skull is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howler first off upon their initiation into the skull each new member ha to have a skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently cover up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society wa being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new member like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters gee why not member t shirt but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skull doe not bother with individual agree or disagree notion when making collective decision they are given official skull paddle when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way mean a disagreement wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddle for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong i m still chuckling about these ludicrous detail but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combine a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawson s creek crowd and fuse the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actor like craig t nelson a skull chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson a fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricature and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there s christopher mcdonald who ha the capacity to be a fun exciting actor mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here a he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue make it a hat trick i pray it wa a snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actor the young troupe of performer involved fair moderately better let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blue is bland but passable a caleb mandrake the judge s son walker preserve a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who play luke s longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boil down to the actor attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cage them from minute one or maybe not minute one thanks to a decent set up from director rob cohen who film early sequence with a sense of atmosphere and style it make you wonder why he didn t flee indefinitely from the project because while enjoyable cheese like dragonheart and the moderate stallone thriller daylight aren t superior cinema they belong on the afi top list when compared to this degrading trash aside from unintentionally humoring the audience the skull get little accomplished the thrill and action are lazy and mechanical the story is stuffed with ridiculous formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlook the cool potential of a secret underground society flick instead of gaining knowledge about the skull a an organization we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that ha developed barnacle from excessive usage we ve seen it all before and better the skull is a feeble

      "Opinió: written by alex cox tod davy terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ve always preferred mushroom to blotter acid dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peak and valley are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then there s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine laced dose mushroom on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing acid is for daredevil mushroom are for refined seeker of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in la vega director terry gilliam ha made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie full of shocking sight gag aggressive image and grotesque comic performance the film certainly offer something for those fan of hunter s thompson s book who want to experience it twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out but for those of u who just want to enjoy a well made film gilliam ha produced a mixed bag fear and loathing tell the ostensibly true story of how self professed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to la vega to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of mean in operating under the pseudonym of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vega on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multi colored upper and downer they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bat on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizard in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of a thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just a jefferson airplane s white rabbit reach it climax and these guy don t just trash hotel room they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them end up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompson s book besides being a hilarious read ha stood the test of time a an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the s drug culture for the sham that it wa and exposed la vega a the place where the american dream came to die pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson s message but the truth is that stripped to it bare essential what gilliam ha wrought is a drug comedy it s a cheech and chong movie you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemical and then laugh at the result see johnny take drug see johnny fall down there s nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam try too hard this is a frantic movie all sweaty close ups wide angle lens dutch tilt and other worldly lighting scheme there are time when gilliam really doe put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but to what end much of the dialogue come verbatim from thompson s book and there are some priceless comic observation but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings u to the performance which strike me a all wrong depp play thompson a groucho mark filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which work against the biting satire of thompson s dialogue in between his several puking scene del toro fare better a dr gonzo but he also mumble and sputter so many of his line that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty year ago with dan akroyd and john belushi a the lead now that would have been something to see it s interesting to note that alex cox credited a a co writer on the screenplay wa originally slated to direct before gilliam took over a much of a fan a i am of gilliam s work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy cox s best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox wa able to pull back and allow the character of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie wa he trying to make anyway it doesn t try to be a cautionary tale and it doesn t work a broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film but i don t want to be too hard on it there are some truly funny moment and if you re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it i do however recommend watching fear and loathing in la vega under the influence of your favorite

will try to vary word description of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative term and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and can not comprehend fret not it s most likely just another way of referring to sex i think we d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review though not a boring a the movie which make steve forbes flat tax plan seem a lively a watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongo while high on god know what body shot is a film so frightened of coitus that scene of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you d normally expect to see a violent attack it s about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are thing we all do sometimes the character in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicity of sexual act their life center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it s a if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek at it core body shot is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church group showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping ugli a if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say his character don t communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer give them an opportunity to let out their inner thought by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitude like i like to come or sex without love equal violence huh and yes that is a complex a this movie s observation get the character are stupid and shallow with not one registering a anything more the plot concern vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such event we meet the character a they speak directly to u confiding in u with their idiotic rumination on intimacy i would normally go into the character and the actor who play them giving you the pro and con but for this film i can not i m not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston a a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breast defined ab pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin i vaguely recall brad rowe a the sensitive one only because his character get the worst line sex without love equal violence in between all the confessional cristoffer film everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mo and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffle me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that it tag line claim to be defining if body shot is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f k obsessed fine i don t have any problem with a film that try to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only give u one side additionally that one side isn t even entertaining the character indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter take place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive character they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ala if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn t it erotic it isn t real it doesn t feel like an authentic sexual encounter every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shot make fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it show u none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show u why it character love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaf u with several tedious plot line to follow the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred the film show u two separate version of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both version the young actress playing the possible victim get her shirt torn off this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serf me i can t think of one film that ha done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movie of the s next to wall street unfortunately nobody give u reason to care not the writer the director or the actor nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie night in a manner similar to what cristoffer doe here though boogie night succeeded it wa similarly moralistic but it gave u two different viewpoint it showed u how the lifestyle of porn enticed it character and it showed u the possible fall out of such a decision the character in boogie night were a idiotic a the character are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer give them nothing but raging hormone he preaches to u by using his character to preach to u this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct a public service announcement on the peril of hittin

      "Opinió: meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood scream the television ad for hanging up disastrously written by real life sister delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focus on middle sister meg ryan and give her two co star lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameo but they don t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minute and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion eve mark meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in year ha just recently been put into the hospital in the final stage of what i assume is alzheimer s even though the film never enlightens u on exactly what is wrong with him while eve s relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her child year ago she ha had her fair share of up s and down s with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress interestingly their profession are given but we not once ever see them working at their job or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult life gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan a it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable minute catastrophe that feel like it three hour long if you are able to get through the opening half hour in which phone ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating self involved pat on the back how could a comedy drama that ha the star power of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different way issue from the past involving the possible jealousy each ha had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isn t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that come off a nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sister have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little child you can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to term with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food fight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credit meg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than s hurlyburly or s when a man love a woman despite her various detractor who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedy with hanging up the only thing she need to do is completely sever her filmmaking tie with nora ephron a writer director hack who shouldn t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even if she knew what she wa making wa not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scene that work flashback to christmas when she had a heartbreaking run in with her mother and to halloween when lou crashed her son s birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situation diane keaton a georgia is better a an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment what is more than a little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpse we get at them a child she is no more than five year ryan s senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow ha been wasted once again in a big screen venture after her even more thin role in s analyze this kudrow isn t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isn t her fault she doesn t register until a few quiet moment sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time a in her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work in s the opposite of sex if you are a fan of kudrow s and who isn t do yourself a favor and rent this gem that put more good use to kudrow in sixty second than hanging up doe in it entirety a eve s hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that give him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman a with ryan and matthau make a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg a a rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas flashback manages one of the few laugh in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotion displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the character aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brat if for some bizarre twilight zone

the movie not only is it a pathetically bad film overall but cigarette actually ha no redeeming quality whatsoever the plot is scattered thin and predictable the acting is monumentally bad and the style of film making resembles a home video it is december and the big party is at monica s martha plimpton house but no one ha arrived yet her invited guest and several people that they have picked

they all are to face their own personal neurosis before night s end those who are invited are the one that have the issue it is up to those who aren t to help them come to term first there is eric brian mccardie who is a former boyfriend of monica s and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance or lack thereof he is one of the most bland character in a film full of dullness because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical a common trait of this poor production bridget nicole parker and caitlyn angela featherstone who are both extremely sensuous young woman looking for someone to handle their desire on new year s eve and tag along to the party with them they stumble across a nameless bartender ben affleck who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfection he is nether sexually deprived nor uncertain about his future a he is in law school his lack of flaw is both boring unrealistic and painful to watch a bridget and caitlyn make pass at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub standard comedy moving on there is val christina ricci and stephie gabby hoffman teenage girl with fake identification and very different thought val is monica s cousin and a true fan of the new york scene on the other hand stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual location in search of the party that they just can t find paradoxically it is punk that they meet at a bar actually they attempt to flee from their presence but aren t successful who guide them through their fear and force a level of relaxation upon their warped mind of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couple only one approach a level of decency in both acting and plot wisely the movie s creator have put heavy emphasis on lucy courtney love and kevin paul rudd who are best friend and share the common bond of being dateless paul ha just broken up with long time steady ellie janeane garofalo and is starting to come to term with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship however the only complexity to

evening finally there are the two worst performance and worst sub plot of the film jack jay mohr and cindy kate hudson have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy s virginity the night before while she attempt to play this down and be her usual self he is a predictably self loathing male a he attempt to deal with a string of one night stand that includes the recently deflowered cindy very often when a film is a putrid a this production there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory however this film ha neither the quality of cinematography nor the moment of glory to be highlighted instead what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cut bad continuity and inaccuracy first and most noticeable is that a the film go from one subplot to another there is no apparent order that it follows and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot at other time object seem to get up and move and hairstyle and costume change from shot to shot there are also at least scene in a taxi cab that go from start to finish not in a single one of them doe anybody pay the driver and yet no matter how miserable this film may be and no matter how poor the acting is all around there wa a ray of a hope for these many bad plot perhaps if the maker had just decided to concentrate on one or two or perhaps even three there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development or quality acting or even a decent plot payoff at the end but

      "Opinió: paul verhoeven the dutch auteur who dragged his violent sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film ha never been what i d consider a thoughtful director though some of his film notably starship trooper have been lauded a artistic achievement but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who s managed to no matter what the budget make his film distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating theme into the lavish high concept on which he toil starship trooper wa essentially a b monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange a great film that s nearly impossible to find on video yet showgirl is everywhere in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequin the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards who may actually be silicone in what feel like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scene of graphic carnage it s not a completely successful film but a a failure it s certainly an interesting and mostly entertaining one my favorite verhoeven film were the one he made before he hit our shore spetters a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange haven t yet gotten around to seeing the th man or turkish delight i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop a bleak super hero satire with a robotic hero that s a touching a schwarzenegger s in t that movie wa violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pic it violence seemed to be there for a purpose namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience there s a jaw dropping scene within the first ten minute of robocop wherein the lead villain toy with a cop before snuffing him he torture the officer by taking glee in his victim s every fearful tic it s a startling moment of barbaric maddening violence that effectively set the tone for the film that could be designated a splatter punk noir in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won t shut up he impales a co worker drowns another and so on but why his character is introduced a a smug genius the kind who s always impeccably dressed and race a sport car while generic rock tune blare from his stereo for the world to hear sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place though once the character becomes invisible this film ha him pull a shift into a psychotic movie monster the kind who just won t die hollow man s protagonist are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda elizabeth shue acting a if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm and her lover a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who s saddled with the film s worst line i ve lost cohesion again they re a typical aaron spelling couple good looking but a vacant a george w bush s republican national convention speech i e bush referring to clinton so much promise but to what end to what end this actually got applause suddenly warren beatty doesn t look so absurd the rest of the film s character are all well past thirty though act like annoying high school party animal insulting one and other with a series of strained one liner is it just me or have labored insult become big budget hollywood s new character developing technique ahh what a cynical time we live in a the picture open we meet cain kevin bacon an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientist on a top secret so top secret the government ha only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at they ve performed several experiment on animal and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the film s s late show origin to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglect to let the pentagon in on his plan and somehow get two of his co worker to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complication then he inexplicably it s hinted that the process of invisibility ha made the animal into more savage creature but this is never explored and if that wa the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human begin raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s film that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lack any trace of wit insight and make no statement other than audience will pay for anything these day it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrill a minute ride verhoeven ha instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the preview make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self a couple week ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friend and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flick never go so far a to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy good but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feel icky and uncomfortable the director keep his camera trained at his nubile actress caressing their breast with his lens all while faux psycho music strain in the background it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it s funny that with all the technology million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply a gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein character do stupid thing just so the villain can pop up for more attack in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victim don infer red glass that track his body heat a in every mad slasher film we get the killer pov a scene where he spy on his neighbor while she undress triggered unpleasant memory of slumber party massacre and lot of scene where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy it happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who look like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pause are you looking at me she query obviously haunted it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effect set to a plot that should have run it course by the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effect are so stunning they alone keep this from being a bad a

      "Opinió: tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movie to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic area it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it s not bad in the way great colossal misfire like heaven s gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drip off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it wa made in the first place with all the good script lying around hollywood un produced how doe needless drek like this make it way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed character in all of motion picture history he ha appeared in over forty film which have ranged from the very good s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the ape down to the really bad s tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these film were just cheapie b movie made in the thirty and forty starring ex olympic athlete and a lot of cutsie chimp therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the mi guided audacity to sexualize the story a a vehicle for bo derek s bare breast tarzan and the lost city on the other hand ha absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storyline and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about a formulaic and generic a they come comic book have better plot than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that wa so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy george of the jungle didn t the producer think to leave that back in the old weissmuller picture where it belongs the story start with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tell of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by ape and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie start in he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologist grave robber named nigel raven steve waddington begin hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa s last great secret the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuse to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaf she change her mind and track him down therefore assuring lot of lame smooch scene between her and her ape man once the film get going in it own sluggish way it delf into a series of jungle adventure a tarzan jane and the native attempt the thwart raven and his crew from discovering the city most of the so called adventure are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequence stolen from innumerable recent adventure movie ranging from raider of the lost ark to the goony when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeace friendly scene of tarzan freeing caged animal releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusk into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who wa raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do instead he tie a tourniquet around his arm and stumble off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with the special effect are not worthy of a made for tv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunter had to slog through numerous underground cavern to get to the lost pyramid when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn t even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance come real close this movie prof what starship trooper only hinted at he can not act but he sure look well groomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the make up department wa thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington make a decent villain although he s like a charmless version of belloq from raider of the lost ark a jane the ex model jane march ha little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she doe fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunter a time or two but whenever a snake come into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking

      "Opinió: i went to blair witch project book of shadow with the highest of hope the original film released last summer wa genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to it predecessor unfortunately my hope were soon dashed a the movie open the audience is shown pseudo documentary clip of burkittsville maryland resident being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town a a result of the original blair witch project movie it s a mostly humorous self aware poke at the medium hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sell blair witch related memorabilia from his website the movie then cut to a title that informs u that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that wa selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only find in bad horror movie we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette smoking doctor luridly leer above him we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall a a fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scene are barely referred to again i had a sinking feeling during these opening scene generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interior and evil doctor is a sure sign that you are in the throe of a truly horrible movie the movie cut again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan a in the first movie the character name are identical to the actor name although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there s no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the wood that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sell on his website we meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience steven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand belief that there may be some truth to the rumor of supernatural occurrence she is wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feel nauseated i knew immediately that the character wa pregnant and my intuition wa confirmed a few scene later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did i know because in bad movie nauseated woman are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eye who want to prove that the blair witch wa a good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery kim is dressed completely in black ha extreme goth style makeup on and occasionally display seemingly psychic ability but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it s never explained the party of five head off into the wood a promised they reach the crumbling ruin of the foundation of rustin parr s house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night s event there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site a well but after a few word are exchanged the rival group huff off and make camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minute showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun go down sexual innuendo are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wake up and discovers that their camera equipment ha been completely trashed and that steven and tristen s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shred like snow the videotape are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotape buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tape were found ooh spooky the team go back to jeffrey s house a creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the wood to regroup and review the tape they soon discover that the tape mysteriously skip five hour of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen start having weird dream in which she is the blair witch everybody start finding these weird rune like burn mark on their body steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucination and everything pretty much go to hell in a handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotape which seem to have some kind of weird image on them at about the point that the time jump eventually tristen wanders in mutter something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tape backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hour one of the thing they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotape okay if the videotape were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie wa awful simply awful the character are broadly drawn caricature that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the nature loving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliche were used to illustrate these caricature how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she s pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wear a lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy because he ha jagged teeth and talk like he s straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at it worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the character and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristic in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didn t work on top of being poorly developed most of the character were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had a miscarriage out in the wood and got medical attention at a hospital that look like it belongs in a bad slasher movie let s get on a plane home no i am having these bizarre nightmare and seeing strange vision and i want to find out what s going on ok frankly by the end of the movie i wa rooting for the witch i also felt that there wa simply too much blood n gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing u the horror the witch wa a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror wa all off screen and thus our imagination worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such nicety and went straight for the gross out this wa evident from the opening scene of the mad doctor forcing white goo down jeffrey s throat and continued throughout the film a the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort knife plunge into flesh bloody finger trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it wa too late for me to care this movie didn t stop with showing u the gore either it went for broke and showed u everything by the end of the movie there are no question remaining about the missing five hour it is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail i confess to being someone who prefers horror movie in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpse mere suggestion of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying i have seen interview with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil wa perpetrated only by the human mind i found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it wa in fact the director s intent then he need to have some word with the writer because it wa not made clear at all i know a lot of people who like to go to party and get drunk and stoned out of their mind none of them ha ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucination with a group of other people for the next week or so and if there wa no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch book of shadow wa a horrible movie from the poorly written character to the implausible story to the plot inconsistency to the gross out shot it wa a bad effort through and through | Predicció: 0, Real:

      "Opinió: teenager have a lot of power in hollywood every year countless film will be made targeting that audience in particular and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday night wallet in hand the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add a high school environment that feature everyone from prom queen to math club nerd and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in minute the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous a this part of the population will waste it money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they dont care to judge film quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun time she ha her own personal assistant unlimited supply and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she want more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago medium so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jump at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gu john c reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment a they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minute and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves a high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them i dont think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibility of this situation ever occurring so i wont the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scene show u just how much of a dork she truly wa and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other character do appear that make some of these high school scene both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love story between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette come into her new found life and even cause a rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage film it is chalk full of sexual innuendo and condom humor one scene in particular feature a certain classroom activity involving banana and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other joke are straight forward high school humor that anyone who ha ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still dont recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rule come the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two level having some very black and white transition and although some scene are written to be particular shade of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she make a mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draw the attention of an audience a simply unrealistic it is these quality that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream take home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and a a central character he get to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done part of never been kissed in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he doe an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the hit risky business never been kissed is a mediocre film at best the

laugh from ultra serious jack webb when there wa nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fan still have the d i a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost a hilarious a the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laugh out of webb s rapid fire speech and straight faced seriousness think of the d i a what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he play exactly the same character here a no nonsense old fart who look with disdain at the younger generation and love to give long winded melodramatic speech on any topic in this election year i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie open in characteristic fashion a one recruit after another knock on webb s office door and enters he give each one a different series of cranky criticism before the credit come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much go without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minute of him chewing out his recruit for no reason i wa wondering if there would even be a plot i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rant but the d i give u more much more webb s mission is to make a man out of private owen the local screw up the captain give webb three day to convert owen into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panty and ship him out myself whether the lace panty part refers to webb or owen remains unanswered this of course give webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owen life a living hell for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasure of webb watching here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the word should at least partially convey what i m talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness i ve got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistake of yours you re gon na turn around and i ll be standing right there i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy line like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar where he order a tomato juice he meet a woman who coincidentally also order tomato juice but walk away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine d i webb march over to the table get up in her face and say just what kind of a dame do you think you are bogart he ain t the other d i get one of the few memorable non webb line when he confesses to the girl he s a damn good d i i guess i m just a little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb s way with woman which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene a webb find his way to the woman s place of employment a lingerie store and stand around looking incredibly flustered at the negligee on display you expect me to talk to you in he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bra the woman go off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen a little girl spot him in the store and demand what are you doing in here you re a man aren t you he doesn t reply but you know he s thinking in his head what an odd specie of human so small must be one of those child everyone s been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversion he s responsible for the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance it also continues the owen subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb force his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owen killed during one of their drill after two private hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owen wa that flea you killed a male or female owen reply a male sir webb yell to the platoon this ain t the one that such a scene along with the rest of the movie wa intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it wa all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marine not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldier in the movie with the exception of owen were played by actual marine someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did it make it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there s a scene in the movie where the guy are on their break time discussing something and one of them break into laughter webb burst in the room and shout what did i tell you about laughing to which the private reply sir only

that warning cloud loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screening and scrapped plan for a gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show wa originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studio heavy hitter it eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening wa an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrill or wit remarkable in it banality and brutally uninvolving the avenger is a catastrophic mess which immediately invite comparison to last year s case study in style over substance joel schumacher s much loathed batman robin indeed both film even feature appalling ridiculous sequence which find central character dressed up in fuzzy oversized costume uma thurman who take on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg wa the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audience something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can t be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture a they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actor painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make a much of an inroad a his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange day the duo look the part and admittedly the avenger is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic character a they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmaker chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma a our mr peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigue me but gwyneth paltrow who wa originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent if nothing else it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such a it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip a lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonist superior it sound far better than it play and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it s clearly evident that the picture ha been cut to shred the avenger wa never about gripping drama and our hero accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it s all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approach the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all look good this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig command attention adeptly drawing element both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are a handful of striking visual moment in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bee and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instance fail to stir interest or raise pulse rate by the time the film s climax had arrived my interest wa not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing wave and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bit of visual bravura were the shot assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the round in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it s everything that the avenger is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outing of the year too drearily awful to be savoured a gleefully bad too polished to overlook it deficiency there may be upcoming picture that are even more lifeless than the avenger but i sure hope not | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniel screenplay george lucas producer rick mccallum runtime min u distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic element copyright nathaniel r atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review i ve attempted to obey this rule in recent month but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who go to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star war trilogy mean so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity a a child they are masterful original work of art that mix moving story with what were astonishing special effect at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well i am too young to have seen star war in the theater during it original release but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star war trilogy and the empire strike back in particular are three item on a very short list of why i love movie when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series i got exited when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation and when the first preview were released last thanksgiving i wa ready to see the film but then there wa the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture in the last week before the picture opened while multitude of fan waited outside of theater and stood in the boiling sun day in advance just to be the first one in the theater i wa tired of hearing about it i wa tired of seeing cardboard cut out of the character whenever i went to kfc or taco bell i just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have an anti hype reaction the hype wa unavoidable i understand and accept the hype it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved film of all time get released five minute into the phantom menace i knew there wa a problem who are these jedi knight i asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren t these character being developed before their adventure why is there a special effect shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my question early on later i asked where s the magic of the first three film and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minute by the end of the film i wa tired maddened and depressed george lucas ha funneled his own wonderful movie into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star war film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effect movie of all time it s an embarrassment i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effect shot isn t used there are a few of each but they re all token attempt the fact is george lucas ha created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effect this is not what i wanted to see i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did the story center mostly around qui gon jinni liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely ha a line in the film and their attempt to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly care for her people after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon know that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knight take the boy with them on their journey the bad guy are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough line to register a character there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas ha handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinni not one thing what wa his life like before this film well i imagine he didn t have one that s why he feel like a plot device this probably explains why neeson look so hopeless in the role and why he s recently retired from film i don t blame him honestly obi wan a character i wa really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor ha just a few line so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas ha served u a big emotional void a the centerpiece of his movie thing start to pick up when our character reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd doe a thoughtful job with the role i wa also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin say goodbye to his mother i found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth ha been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying character i ve ever had to endure but he s more interesting than most of the human a soon a the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it s back to the mind numbing special effect and depthless action scene i ve seen many movie that qualify a special effect extravaganza but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effect fifteen minute into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas ha no restraint i can t say that i didn t find the effect original because i did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional a is most of the film but i also found the effect deadening and tiresome my breaking point wa near the end of the picture a anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi master in the background we see hundred of digital spaceship flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effect shot i got so sick of looking at the cgi character and spaceship and planet and background that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hour and then there s the question of magic what wa lost in the sixteen year between the phantom menace and return of the jedi i have a feeling that lucas wa so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction i think it come right down to character there are none here i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectation mine weren t that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the root of the film that i grew up loving a story that had a few character and a few great special effect instead i got two hour and fifteen minute of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphic show i don t hate the phantom menace a much a i resent it i d like to forget that it exists and yet i can t it s here to stay i can only hope that episode ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don t then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series | Predicció: 1, Real: 0\n",

      "Opinió: martial art master steven seagal not to mention director ha built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial art superman who never get hurt in fight talk in a hushed tone and squint at any sign of danger he s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movie suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendency about his art that is martial art i m sure the guy s good and he seems like a nice guy on talk show although a tad haughty but these movie he make are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then come back with a vengeance and go buddha on all the baddie ass although i kinda liked under siege of course this one a a change ha a message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blow up a lot of stuff and kill a bunch of people so why do i watch his crap i usually don t i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this man s movie unless and only unless he s in a supporting role i e executive decision and i d definitely pay if he dy i e executive decision but this one ha a special place in my heart this doesn t mean it s good or that i even liked it this wa the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre and this wa a couple year before i had heard of mystery science theatre in this one seagal play a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine want to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine ha him bumped off or doe he seagal is rescued by some inuit and fall in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine s cliched henchman played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoot the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal give a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any option but blow stuff up he even go a far a to say i don t want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is i have no problem with violence i m a huge john woo fan but he paint his film with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the film of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some point they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain ha the advantage can shoot seagal but begin talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal say something hokey back and ha had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and doe this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer s con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message i wouldn t mind if this wa a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal ha no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer s mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can t take him and his motif seriously and while seagal talk about being kind to the environment he also go ahead and blow up a square mile of rig and kill some worker who were just doing his job then at the end he spends a good minute giving a speech just in case you didn t get the message from the trailer what seagal doesn t realize is that no one take his film seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he ha is no only redundant but doesn t comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and character who have about a much emotional depth a a petri dish a far a seagal and his acting he s rather boring he squint he kill period nothing else oh yeah there s corny one liner i m gon na reach out and touch someone of course he s the star and we re supposed to root for him and all so he make all the villain unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerk michael caine who s a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he doe it well i guess but this is no alfie of coure no one wa expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring a well but is not horrible and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeant on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket a a hired assasin squad leader who get to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailer and for seagal s ego and also look for billy bob thornton a one of ermey s assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal s movie is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one ha that message which make it more excrucitating to watch i mean if you do rent it and i don t reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minute but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle wa a pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

      "Opinió: m i the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it try to be a spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just look like it s an extended commercial for dude who think they look cool in throwaway sunglass it is a film that prefers techie gadget to anything human the coolest thing about this movie wa all the hole it had in it story and the most trite thing about the movie wa the usage of dove throughout a peace symbol the film play a if it wa a wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequence the film wa dull for three quarter of it time filled with too many dead spot in it story to garner concern about it wooden character or the superficial romance that developed a for the action scene they might look good to those who are convert to violence in their film but their advertisement for sadistic response is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which make it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen m i open and close with fast paced action scene but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drag on in banal dialogue the film look a if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake wa the horrible music composed by han zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s supposedly momentous action scene and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series but it artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actor to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chase choreographed fight with midair flip and kung fu kick slo mo shot of two gun blazing and of fire explosion but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and look more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile a he try to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like a fish out of water in this one their romance didn t work not only wa it tepid and not sexy but it wasn t convincing the film open with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is it best bet for success we will be in three different location instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mention that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mention that every hero need a worthy villain which explains the film s mythic theme a we enter the world of comic book myth on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott doe so in a one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trust called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorist who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountain before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who wa posing a dimitri turn out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cia like clone he steal the package with the antidote peel off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed a dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorist carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victim the antidote at marked up price we already saw the gimmick of peeling mask used in face off and in the original mission impossible which a convoluted a plot a that film had it wa still a superior film to this sequel woo ha run this peeling mask routine into the ground a it is used so often in this film by both side so much so that it blur any ethical character difference between good guy or villain it make it seem a if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and make it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertip while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his bos anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglass hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agent to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a high gadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told a an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charge will be dropped hopkins then sign off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five second actually with the departure of hopkins it wa this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruit nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly run her audi sport car over the side of a mountain road he also fall for her when this wa only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend wa sean ambrose and that he still want to f ck her the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him a she lead them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he share with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way the terrorist who aim to rule the world are interested in owning percent in a biotech company and in getting stock option a they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billion on the stock ethan come to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan doe this rescue against all odds a he find a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorist and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it a the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescue her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kick boxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenade at the terrorist making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick s everyone s as if i wa only entertained by this i could have lived with it but this film wa so badly made that it wa like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slam dunk but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is a critic proof film and will in all

      "Opinió: the most interesting part of can t hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of u the one part that many of u can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film s sole sarcastic member who mock everything that go on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and look totally bored the film wisely hold over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some member of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotype much of which i went to high school with everyone s here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominion of trekkies and x philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film show them a superficial lame and basically a a bunch of loser except for denise who roll her eye at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quote oscar wilde definite pointer there unfortunately the writer and director take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film a i said portrays most of it character a superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these character into our hero we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotype with only a shread of humanity and realism and try to tell boring and overly melodramatic tale about them a if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being here s a quick low down it s graduation and we follow a bunch of senior on the last night otherwise known a the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them a they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party can t hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who s been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he think they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his love for her in the hope he ll build up the gut to give it to her even though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what go on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because it s a party there are some more main character such a william charlie korsmo finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominion who ha come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who s humiliated him for year but get too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who ha decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately get stuck in a bathroom don t ask with kenny where the two character let down their character and are allowed to follow the law of plot cliche from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two film that embraced and ultimately made human out of many of it high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes film of the s most notably sixteen candle the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize it main character and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize it character and ultimately tell a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotype and then say that it s all okay we can t take this film seriously nor can we take this a fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some thing i did like i liked the direction except for a couple too over the top feature like way too glossy jump cut it s like an oxymoron and other obscurity generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio day his desintegration of his wigger character wa almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful a denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn t work with the film when really thought about she s far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically give everything a delightfully satirical tone she s not just the cynic or the intellectual she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damage other already damaged character she may ruin the film more but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained a couple other thing that just don t work mike s character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end act a though he ha forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all jenna eflman s uncredited cameo a an angel just didn t work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason i m giving this such a low rating is because it refuse to give u any fully realized character and then insists we follow around complete

      "Opinió: godzilla is the ultimate culmination of the who care about plot summer movie a loose remake of the classic japanese monster movie godzilla king of the monster which is itself pretty thin in the story department roland emmerich and dean devlin s big budget lizard stomp manhattan disaster flick ha been written with the brain dead in mind the script isn t just dumbed down it s lobotomized godzilla life and dy on special effect alone presumably the primary target group for this film is teenage boy the demographic most likely to shell out repeatedly to see the same image of monster instigated carnage that s not to say that female and other age group are immune to the special effect seduction they re just not a readily susceptible this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actor stargate wa a financial success independence day wa a runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie in before it even open it s virtually guaranteed at least million nice number for a film that could have been penned by a not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn t completely without merit although it is close there s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wear off quickly frankly while the special effect are competent they re not all that stunning there s nothing new here it s jurassic park meet alien with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star war movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level godzilla never really push the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone the imagination of monster movie like king kong ha been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla ha been chosen to close the st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isn t even exciting with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn t a sequence in this film that raise the pulse even the scene with dozen of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but it wa full of adrenaline moment capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of it production a in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin human trying to stop him the plot such a it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking a few ship and leaving some footprint on tropical island godzilla show up in the big apple he doe some of the usual tourist thing stop by madison square garden visit the chrysler building go on a walk through central park and take the subway in the process he knock over a few building and step on countless cab but he never ha trouble with traffic jam on hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who ha a theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportion a a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb test in the south pacific in nick s word godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of it kind a luck would have it nick s old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around a he trail godzilla then just when the military ha rejected nick s theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruit him for a special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla ha chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan ha been destroyed so many time in recent disaster movie independence day deep impact armageddon that it s becoming boring the whole tradition of monster roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape wa only about foot tall he could climb the empire state building at ten time that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains a few lame attempt at humor there s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that play like sit com material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick s last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critic roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personality have alter ego in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager ebert s re election slogan is not surprisingly thumb up for new york the siskel ebert stuff is amusing the first time it s used but after a while it grows tiresome and although the character don t serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesn t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard that s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren t capable of good performance both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they aren t a list name then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god play the love interest and hank azaria great expectation is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesn t really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar ha assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion picture is pretty much critic proof it may also be word of mouth proof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friend say so when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movie of all time it s like spitting into the wind emmerich

      "Opinió: in the continuation of warner brother s franchise joel schumacher ha successfully killed this cash cow what make this film such a grand disappointment is the tremendous line up of talented people involved with the film avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project a the client is such a shock that it give rise to thought that the latter film wa a fluke situation are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the character from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl who just happens to be alfred s niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue a an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he ha become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escape me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she want to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she join with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creation no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the character have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier film now that he ha an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homily about family and relationship while at the same time not really having any george clooney try in vain to keep from rolling his eye while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performance are still on e r bruce wayne ha the most unromantic evening with his girlfriend played by elle macpherson that it brings into question bruce s latent homosexuality there is no spark and no passion a there wa for nicole kidman s psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin come off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he s just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smack of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris o donnell once considered a rising star successfully burn up on reentry with this performance his robin need nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better this talented young actress read her line with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she wa cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings u to the villain arnold scharzenegger walk through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze s imprisonment the guard are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fight scene caught on film it s almost a ludicrous a seeing michael jackson a a gang member umu thurman strut and coo her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy ha all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performance worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veteran carry their scene with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacy of the plot there is one question that always come to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villain manage to hire so many thug only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlum that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor one have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film warner brother ha succeeded in retrograding the series back to it s tv incarnation the only thing missing from the action scene are the superimposed title detailing the pow gwaaaa s and clang s associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalty from this film the special effect by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary star of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy s lair the batcave to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for year to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effect have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effect have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scene are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher ha directed the film with no flair camera angle are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shot pepper the action scene destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just ha to look back on the film the lost boy cousin an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin come off a a mated made for tv movie the film ha no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even

      "Opinió: star armand assante mike hammer barbara carrera dr charlotte bennett laurene landon velda alan king charles kalecki geoffrey lewis joe butler paul sorvino detective pat chamber judson scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma child mpaa rating r review in the updating of mickey spillane s novel i the jury hard boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drive a shiny bronze trans am dress like don johnson in miami vice with less pastel and ha sworn off alcohol however he still smoke his lucky strike detests all form of authority and kill at a whim beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writer the movie start off with a bang a howler of an opening credit sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphic and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick down a one armed detective and hammer s best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chamber paul sorvino he is immediately on the killer s trail here the movie split completely from the book and dive into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactic involving the mafia the cia one of hammer s vietnam vet buddy and a kinky sex clinic many of the same character from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different role for instance charles kalecki alan king a number runner and narcotic dealer in the book turn into a suave mob bos and more importantly hammer s suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic i the jury is one of several cinematic rendition of spillane s book including a version which wa made in d but this film differs from those earlier version in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s production code although this take the version of i the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extreme that many argued surpassed what wa in the book rest assured the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward woman it feature one woman having her neck slashed a set of twin forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillane s writing ha a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment it constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it s no surprise that the movie like the book fade to black with a dead woman on the floor i the jury had a troubled production and wa not well supported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theater and many people have forgotten that it wa ever made the script wa written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movie like it s alive and it two sequel q and the stuff cohen wrote the script thinking he wa going to helm the project a well but he wa yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he wa already over budget he wa quickly replaced by richard t heffron who ha worked for the last three decade on a handful of undistinguished movie and dozen of television project heffron wa obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it show in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron ha none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scene ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie feature numerous car chase shoot out and stunt but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity i the jury take on the air of a made for tv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problem in i the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character wa lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifty to the eighty because spillane wrote all his hammer mystery in the first person hammer s character is central to the tale because all the event are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no first person voice over narration and some scene don t have hammer in them at all consequently a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost the period updating turn out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization a a hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself i the jury refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law unlike private eye who seek out the bad guy and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen a above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer come off not only a amoral in society s term but in any term especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie doe away with that in the first three minute by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife wa being unfaithful maybe the scene wa intended for laugh but it only cheapens hammer s character and is by all account a lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulder because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling he delivers a fine performance spillane never once described hammer s physical attribute in any of the dozen book in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillane s book will have a strong personal notion of what hammer look like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectation spillane who played the character himself in s the girl hunter is generally considered the best of the film hammer the rest of actor are most un noteworthy with the exception of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were up and comer who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mid eighty which only add to the made for tv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right element together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

      "Opinió: synopsis cro magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escape certain death by a lion reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who like to have sex doggy style ayla grows up to become a blond feminist supermodel who challenge the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rock and giving birth without a mate comment allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movie she proved quite charming a the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy a pris in the sci fi classic blade runner the clan of the cave bear clearly try to capitalize on hannah a a selling point the poster art bear a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently feature her name in lettering the same size a the title not even her starring role in this turkey unfortunately can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese it s so uniquely bad a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually try and miserably fails to be serious that it s oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaf the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud play out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read a a child with all the so called dirty part blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope it s time better than it film adaptation if not then i m at a complete loss to explain it popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately open with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramp about in the wood with her cute little ponytail and fur wrapped about her the audience s expectation of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallow up ayla s mother a blonde with fur pant er legging tearful ayla look on a the cameraman shake the camera well a the earthquake slowly recedes a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch but the screaming six year old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven i won t detail the story any further this seems enough to illustrate my point this movie is really stupid it never even give the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief also the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about a subtle a burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston the movie doesn t just suggest this message it whack the message into the audience with a two by four a blond gorgeous woman challenge the social law of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wig she s of the new people they re of the old people with the memory yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprise me the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing a stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she look like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the character have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from it new age trapping maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sound dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film s faux mysticism including spirit animal and dream vision and a narrator who sound like a psychic you d expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that ha serious problem being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive film i ve seen in quite a while it contains several scene of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scene the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempt to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bite his head off and the audience see it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous i m sure it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however a i wrote at the beginning of this review it doe have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottom of the barrel film dealing with early man fantasy movie involving dinosaur who did not exist at the same time a man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear try so hard to be serious that though it s so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and character of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two star i have to think that fan of the book would be disappointed with this film version however i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

      "Opinió: if anything stigma should be taken a a warning against releasing similarly themed film relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flick released this year it is clearly the worst i suppose i should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense wa mildly spooky and then stir of echo had it moment but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer ha slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigma is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while no not really patricia arquette play frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary a a gift from her globe trotting mother a it turn out the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who ha made a career out of disproving supposed religious sign but this time he belief there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie start exhibiting sign of the stigma in which a person is inflicted with wound like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering she s an atheist but once he witness the stigma attack himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begin to suspect that his bos cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church a it turn out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video i mean film stigma is the sort of film that start off ok and only get worse indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because it s only interesting for about five minute i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he ha the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he ha been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such a it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what i can do i m an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scene with slow motion shot of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shot a that of an egg frying ooh scary if there wa some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didn t see it just when you thought it wa safe to get involved in the story here come a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if stigma had a story or character that were remotely engaging though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help he doe seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren t given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she s kind of cute so let s start the bleeding the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wound on your wrist and back go clubbing sure that make sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their character are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scene between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reach the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eye she still find the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advance father andrew s religious doubt pop up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic a for pryce he may a well wear a curled mustache and cackle i ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turn out to be a villain what s worse after being faced with dull character and the prospect of having annoying camera trick and loud music jammed down our throat we now have to contend with a story that start off in one direction veers off in another then another and end up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot detail how doe frankie get the stigma merely by touching a rosary how come an atheist like her wa chosen since father andrew mention that only very devout believer have ever received stigma actually i m not sure what frankie wa posessed by supposedly stigma occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later ha her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effect and flashy camera work mr wainwright want to use this time furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmaker compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church a the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there s nothing the catholic need to worry about though stigma s religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priest a mobster they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suit and tommy gun which would have been far more interesting i m not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but it cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any mean it s rare to see a film that fails on a many level a stigma doe it s not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretend to be i m not sure why they tried to pas this off a a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scene have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many film of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigma that it eventually ha no effect on the audience leaving u to pick out the film s many flaw i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sound like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which mean that for all it flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog day of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigma is it | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",
      "Opinió: john boorman s zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it take on a bizarre enjoyment quality all it own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr ha a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood s career can be explained by two thing he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand can not court such excuse to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn t know it from this film boorman doe indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance a well a the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest his film all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that come at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he s ambitious and when he succeeds it s in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman fall the resounding impact can be heard for mile around zardoz is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystical movie an obsession of boorman s his screenplay try to elicit the same mythological connotation of the arthurian legend or even the wizard of oz a book which figure into the movie s plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the event take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact thing seems to have moved backwards with people riding horse shooting old style gun and living in large victorian mansion it s more middle age than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemisphere the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectual live in comfort and everlasting life these immortal never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological power and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one break the rule that person is punished by being aged so many year if someone break the rule enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminal one of the immortal arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the resident to farm so the immortal can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head this flying head is one of the movie s opening image and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gather a bunch of outlander and make them into a group called the exterminator whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlander so they can t procreate and take up more resource from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellow seriously laugh inducting statement like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie s cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneak into zardoz s flying stone push frayn out and go back to the vortex once there the immortal label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientist show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what get him worked up i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of face although i have a hard time believing that a production moved forward he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it wa becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggle he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and a pair of thigh high patent leather boot that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both side of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in and perhaps he wa looking for a change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it s a wonder it didn t end his career i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statement is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinction and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it a an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substance are the only one i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness a anything more than a completely unintentional comedy | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",
      "Opinió: the kid in the hall are an acquired taste it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer maybe after watching a half dozen kid in the hall movie they would grow into the big screen my recommendation is that unless you are a big fan of the kid skip the film a it is their first and most likely only attempt at a full length film lack the quality that made their comedy work on tv a big budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show the kid go through the motion but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so and this make it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antic brain candy is a bunch of skit tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression in typical sketch comedy tradition each actor play several role doctor cooper kevin mcdonald and his team create the drug then under pressure from don roritor mark mckinney founder and president of roritor pharmaceutical dr cooper release the drug into the marketplace the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drive the rest of the film at about minute brain candy still seems long the best thing about sketch comedy and the kid are no exception is the ability to quickly deliver the laugh then go on to another quick skit but with the additional set up necessary in telling a longer coherent story the laugh just dont come fast enough strangely the show is even more tame than it wa when on cable tv the movie make several attempt at risqueness mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompson character but they seem almost forced a if they have to live up to a pg rating one of the best bit though doe make use of thompson naked buttock we see him charging into battle going to have sex with some guy taking a shower in the classic of this genre monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail the kid unfortunately are not up to the task there are some amusing moment to be sure but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",
      "Opinió: there wa a time when john carpenter wa a great horror director of course his best film wa s masterpiece halloween but he also made s the fog and s underrated prince of darkness heck he even made a good film in with in the mouth of madness but something terribly wrong happened to him in with the terrible comedy memoir of an invisible man somehow carpenter ha lost his touch with junk like his failed remake of village of the damned to his uninspired sequel escape from l a those movie however look like cinematic work of art compared to his latest film john carpenter s vampire if i wa him i definately wouldn t want to put my own name in the title it is a sad state of affair when carpenter can make something a misguided and flatly written and filmed a vampire the story is simple jack crow james wood is a vampire hunter who along with one of his partner montoya daniel baldwin and a prostitute katrina sheryl lee survives an attack from the master vampire valek thomas ian griffith since katrina wa previously bitten by him crow take her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampire a couple day later and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her it seems valek s mission is to steal a black wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him my question is how many time have we seen this same story played out well the answer is just about a many time a a better version of the story ha been made john carpenter s vampire sadly enough is one of the most unscary horror film i ve ever seen in fact there isn t even one suspenseful moment in the whole minute running time the non stop vampire attack sequence are stylelessly filmed without any interesting camera work which is usually a trademark of carpenter s and then we come to the screenplay which a far a i can tell is nearly non existent there is no story development and there isn t even an attempt to flesh out the character james wood can be a good actor but he ha nothing to do here but to say a couple of pseudo clever line of dialogue daniel baldwin ha some potential but his character come off a being very dense and sheryl lee faring much better a laura palmer in twin peak like all of the female character play an offensive stereotypical whore there is not an ounce of intelligence or excitement in john carpenter s vamires which is very disheartening coming from an ex fan of carpenter s he ha said that he turned down directing halloween h because he couldn t work up any excitement for it and yet when asked about a vampire sequel he said he would be happy to do it i think that s a definite sign that carpenter ha finally lost any trace of his lasting talent not to mention a significant number of iq point | Predicció: 0, Real: 0\n",

      "Sentence: when people are talking about good old time they actually want to make some bad time look better nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular medium towards the s for new generation superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion cult tv show and sexual freedom unchecked by aid for people who actually had to live in that period it wa the gloomy decade marked by lost ideal of rampant inflation and unemployment international terrorism fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for feeling of despair and nihilism found it reflection in many film of that era martin scorsese s taxi driver which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventy is most celebrated of them all the movie s protagonist is travis bickle robert de niro year old former marine who take the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can t sleep at night the job get him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis and travis gradually get alienated from the rest of world the only bright spot in his life is betsy cybil sheperd attractive woman working in senator palantine s presidential campaign their date end a humiliating fiasco because travis make fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre losing his only link to better side of the world travis gradually descends into psychosis becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street he purchase a formidable arsenal of gun and begin physical preparation for the inevitable conflict that conflict finally come when he take personal interest in iris jodie foster year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi a many great movie that got cult status through the year taxi driver became the object of many interpretation for some critic and scholar it is an exploration of universal subject that date back to dostoyevski loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty overpopulated industrial city the story could have been set in th century same a in our time for others the movie us raskolnikov like figure in order to portray burning problem of s america it apparent inability to deal with the consequence of rapid social change that occurred in previous decade brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give argument for both side his travis bickle ha a lot in common with most of the average viewer of today many of u share his feeling of isolation loneliness and outrage towards crime drug prostitution and senseless street violence his pathetic attempt to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him sometimes in most unusual circumstance like with secret service agent pimp or job interviewer make him a person too goofy to be the hero and too pathetic to be the classic villain however most of the average viewer are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizen or troubled soul from fanatical madman but despite anything average viewer at the end actually cheer for travis his crusade against scum is something that average person want but doesn t have a stomach lack of brain to do it while de niro s travis might come in and out of particular time and place other person that appear in the film mostly played by the character actor give it distinctively s feel wizzard played by peter boyle present the only link with america s better past but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he know stuff his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre s generation to find answer to the problem of gloomy decade other character on the other hand show the bad side of new age matthew sport keitel who befriended real life pimp in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime is dressed like a hippie iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drug and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture porno movie that should be the element of new time of sexual freedom are too much even for supposedly liberated betsy even the politician like senator palantine are lost in post vietnam and post watergate mess his broad and senseless message that cover the lack of any serious program can t fool even such idiot like travis the past is gone the present is bad and even the future seems bleak and the feeling of pessimism can t be washed away even by ironic happy end travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation and martin scorsese us the best of his cinematic skill in order to spill the gloom of schrader s screenplay into the silver screen new york city in the night is portrayed a a hell on earth and the red light and steam coming out of sewer give it surreal almost stygian atmosphere another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman whose efficient use of jazz element give some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture one of the greatest irony of taxi driver is the fact that the movie wa same a his protagonist famous for the wrong reason instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merit for many year it wa tabloid fodder because of hinckley and his real life re enactment of event in the movie now more than two decade later when some other life imitating art incident get more attention we can finally

      "Sentence: warren beatty s bulworth is a caustic political comedy that doesn t attack any particular political group but rather the ingrained insincerity that ha infected the american political system some might think this film is vulgar and in many way it is however a loud and raucous a it is bulworth speaks the truth which is almost always ugly to hear beatty who directed the film and co wrote the script with jeremy pikser the lemon sister star a incumbent u s senator jay billington bulworth who ha one of the best politician name in cinema history bulworth is a democrat and in beatty s view he is symbolic of everything that ha gone wrong with the current democratic party once an ideological liberal like beatty still is bulworth ha long since succumbed to the materialistic pressure of washington instead of waging the battle for the impoverished and the downtrodden which wa once the calling card of democrat bulworth ha become another sell out money hound if he s not accepting illegal bribe from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contribution from the chinese he s making wind bag speech that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium blah blah blah when the film open it is a few day before the primary election and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he ha become in a fit of desperation he take out a million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee and then hire a hit man to kill him although he doesn t know who the assassin will be or when the hit will take place knowing that he will soon be dead bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world which is made up of politically incorrect truth about the state of american politics and the society in general at a compton church he tell the group of african american that they will have no power in the u s unless they put down that malt liquor and chicken wing and get behind somebody other than a running back who stab his wife later in a particularly hilarious sequence bulworth mix with the hollywood elite then insult the quality of their movie and informs them that the only reason he s there is because my guy always put the big jew on my schedule all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade bulworth s chief of staff dennis murphy oliver platt follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment platt ha some of the movie s funniest scene a he make murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet his constant half truth telling and spin doctoring to cover bulworth s stampede is equaled in it perversion only by a self righteous reporter nora dunn who act like murphy s refusal to explain bulworth s action something he really can not do is somehow an act of treason when bulworth decides he want to live after all and therefore must constantly evade a grim looking assassin to be who s trailing him at every turn he hide out in the ghetto complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wear to one of his television interview at this point beatty abandon much of the political aspect and dive into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner city experience bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina halle berry who he meet at the harlem church rally she ha a tough talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l d don cheadle of boogie night who also becomes involved in bulworth s campaign some of the scene in the ghetto ring true but much of it feel like a lighter version of scene depicted in more intense inner city film like boyz n hood and menace ii society bulworth s chief liability is beatty s insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap a his new communication device instead of speaking at political rally he break into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip hop star are black it s hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad or whether he s actually that incompetent at any rate the rap sound more run d m c than snoop doggy dogg which make the film seem dated instead of contemporary beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner city lingo and working that into his speech instead of trying to sound like l l cool j other than that bulworth hit all it target with wry hilarious accuracy the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party and even if you don t agree with beatty s liberal message about the unrequited duty of the federal government it is hard to deny the impact the film ha in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics unlike primary color which opened earlier this year bulworth doesn t try to tip toe around the truly painful issue that hit close to home instead it take them dead on\n",

starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brother steven wa it any good well just about a good a baldwin s steven seagal impression for those i ve confused the answer is a resounding no now let me clarify i don t love just any cop movie i m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flick that were so in vogue in the s and now slowly gulp returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker i m partial to those gritty earthy cop drama like serpico donnie brasco and the french connection problem is these film come along just about a often a george w bush make a cogent point so whenever a true cop movie doe hit multiplex i come running towards it like an eager puppy and inevitably i leave head bowed tripping over my squiggly tail so what is it about cop movie that transform me into a moron willing to shell out for a movie called one tough cop which actually sound a lot like a wiseguy spin off no truth is i m a sucker for those barren street that gritty graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminal lurk and cop like modern day knight must shield u from their iniquitous clutch yes it s all very corny and awfully boy clubish which i m guessing is precisely where these feeling come from a little tot u boy are brought up to create our own war with gi joe s enact cop and robber or cowboy and indian fantasy etc the best gritty cop film tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasy and heighten them turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral line and psychological chaos a an adult my taste haven t changed all that drastically sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexity of a krzysztof kieslowski film but i still delight at the promise a guy film could potentially bring now what if it s the cop who re the corrupt one ooh that one really get me going these protector using all that at their service taking advantage of others for their own gain throw a courtroom drama yech into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city how absorbing is prince of the city you ask so damn absorbing that when the film shift from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama a sub genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar i remained completely and utterly involved the film star treat williams who give the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at since i wa hatched a mere two year prior to the release of prince of the city i can not provide an answer a to why it didn t though judging from his recent role in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably ha something to do with quite a few bad career move like mickey rourke and eric robert both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory williams is a talented leading man who didn t make it to where he should have if there wa any justice in this dog gone world keanu reef would be the one banished to direct to video hell here the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino s in serpico also directed by lumet williams play danny ciello a member of an elite squad of police officer who take down drug dealer on the gritty pre juliani street of new york they work without uniform or hour much like paid vigilante and that analogy is more than apt seeing a how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt mean to get the job done the squad relies entirely on informant low level junky to gain access to the big wig and in order to obtain the info they seek they sometimes have to provide the junky with the junk of their choice danny ha done this and though he s a fairly honorable guy who took the job in order to do good his intention have gotten a bit skewed along the way he seek redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affair who then convince him to go undercover a a double agent he doe so with one condition he will not rat on his partner right away we know that that is exactly what he ll have to do and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be undercover cop film are almost innately exciting even the kind that pull out all the cliche like in too deep how can one not be moved by the issue of betrayal ambiguity and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position prince of the city take all this and charge it with a perceptive hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet a well a a handful of intense performance most notably by treat lumet s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lay back and let the camera soak up the action his scene transition rapidly from one to the next building layer of tension and he rarely hold for reaction shot instead he click away at precisely the moment a character stop yakking lumet s worst tendency is one that many film maker especially oliver stone tend to overuse he relies a little too heavily on actor shouting their line at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension this isn t a much a problem here a it wa in night fall on manhattan lumet s most recent cop lawyer endeavor a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching though of late lumet ha made several really awful career choice maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria here he wa on sustaining tension in a film that run for minute with not one dull spot some of the formula picture i like the best are the most simplistic hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kind of picture even tolerable of course cop movie aren t popular anymore yes buddy cop flick are popular but those are more like extended sitcom with gunfire amid the punch line but just look at the average hollywood action movie flick so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serf no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn t gay the lame comic relief character who s never funny and on and on for all it moral ambiguity prince of the city is a back to the basic cop courtroom drama that leaf out all the crap and really thrill it focus completely on it story and it character all of whom are completely believable from the cop to the lawyer to the junky there s a great scene early on where an irate williams shout at an ia officer and look a if he s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speech but instead he break down in front of the cop and begin sobbing this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film even though bruce willis sacrifice his life at the end of armageddon not one damn tear it would be cut out because the director would say oh that make him too human excuse me weak in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness straining to get the word out he s lost his voice doe that little itty bitty detail matter maybe not to most but it sure made my night and in a sprawling epic of corruption greed betrayal and violence it s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little thing\n",

guy more indignant with him than catty with each other the duo break into blake s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation it s when blake return to his abode where the film hit it stride played with magnificent bombast by mr downey jr blake is a cad all right but a captivatingly dynamic blusterous and stealthy piece of work that burst onto the scene and raise the stake to new height it s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat and perhaps the film s best choice wa to have his two girlfriend scamper off into hiding upon his return allowing u to size up blake not with his interaction with others but by his own innate behaviour whether he s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi or on the phone leaving message to his beloved carla lou and his unseen sickly mother it s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one man show a typical afternoon in the life of blake if you will carla and then lou reveal themselves and the spark begin to fly one of the great touch in the film is how blake when startled by carla s unannounced appearance begin to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat s out of the bag double teamed by the understandably aggrieved woman who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy an increasingly flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self righteous declaration against their verbal jab surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by it trio of character two girl and a guy concludes it first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing wa off limit for this film however it d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou s outrage to full feature length and it s a the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundity on the nature of fidelity and relationship that it slowly but surely begin to unravel the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever the film s tempo loses it liveliness the dynamic between the character evolves in unconvincing fashion and several sequence fall flat subtle and not quite subtle allusion are made a poster of jules et jim hang prominently on the wall and secret are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla two girl and a guy wa embroiled in a bitter long running dispute with the mpaa with regard to this scene contractually obligated to deliver an r rated film mr toback wa forced to resubmit fourteen scaled down version of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc rating in favour of an r and while admittedly titillating the net effect of the vignette on the film s thematic narrative is rather dubious if anything two girl and a guy serf a a showcase for the phenomenal talent of mr downey jr whose versatility is put to the test in this film he play the gamut from indignant to humbled from self assured to disconcerted yet his acting gear shift so smoothly a to not be registered it s a wonderful performance in a role custom tailored for him mr toback wrote the screenplay in four day shortly after mr downey jr wa arrested on drug charge and it s hard not to see echo of reality seeping into his character in a monologue to his mirrored reflection blake s self chiding to get his shit together is disquieting in it resonance while mr downey jr s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film both actress are solid in more broadly observed role m graham is quickly becoming one of america s more daring actress involving herself in three successive risky project two girl and a guy and boogie night are both quite sexually frank while lost in space ha a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman she s quite appealing here playing a character at once both dainty and sultry meanwhile m gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audience are likely to find it either annoying or like me endearing she tone it down substantially a the film progress but i found her more fun to watch a the artificially excitable chatterbox the film wa reportedly shot in eleven day filmed mostly in sequence and the resultant artifact of this rapid shoot are evident throughout two girl and a guy ha an agile spontaneous sort of feel and one sens that mr toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actor while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact it doesn t feel constricted the expansive apartment setting is well used to vary the background and mr toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his character in an effective manner two girl and a guy fall short of it potential but thanks to some stellar work by mr downey jr it s still often an enjoyable bitingly funny romp particularly a we watch the surprisingly resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the table on his girlfriend i m an actor he tell them at one point using the ol tried and tested occupational hazard defense actor lie but not they all seem to agree denzel washington\n",

unfortunately for the devil s advocate this ending nearly collapse in on itself and ruin the entire film nevertheless the film doe provide two and a half hour of pure entertainment note to self kill whomever wa in charge of the preview for this film i don t think i wa quite prepared for this movie because the trailer made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan well it doe contain this element but what is not mentioned in the ad is the other plot element and seemingly more interesting one at that the devil s advocate begin in florida with an ongoing trial in session kevin lomax keanu reef is the defense attorney working for a client whom ha been accused of raping a young girl he end up with a not guilty verdict despite an emotional testimony from the victim heather matarazzo he leaf the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann charlize theron where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury he accepts mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive and he fly to new york with his wife after proving his worth for selecting jury and his perfect winning streak in court the head of the firm john al pacino asks him to work permanently a a criminal lawyer he graciously accepts where he is treated almost a a god he is given an incredible apartment which is bigger than my entire house now and a hefty paycheck his life seems to be on the rise and of course his life suddenly begin to waver and slowly decline he is attracted to fellow employee christabella connie nielson and his wife begin to feel very lonely in her large apartment mary ann take up a friendship with a neighbor who always give advice especially if it is not wanted meanwhile kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen craig t nelson who apparently murdered three people he spends hour upon hour with this case while forgetting his loving wife who may or may not be going insane all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself after a while thing turn completely upside down a kevin s wife claim to have seen monstrous image superimposed on her friend a fellow employee is murdered in the park and his mother judith ivey reveals information about kevin s real father is it all just a big nightmare or is john really satan playing trick with kevin s life the devil s advocate play out fairly straight forward but for some odd reason the screenwriter wanted to surprise everyone by giving u something we don t expect is this surprise conclusion supposed to make u feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed if so the devil s advocate mess up completely and ironically i felt more depressed because of the ending a is now than i would have if it had ended ten minute early i went into the devil s advocate expecting a shocking horror film and that is exactly what i got i wa settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally and that is what i got but what wa the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending did i mention that i didn t like the ending the producer of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just a it is ending they pull the rug out from under you film like seen and the usual suspect can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected more or less we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way the devil s advocate on the other hand end unpredictably not from u knowing a lot but knowing nothing at all if that is confusing i recommend watching the film and then reading that again a for the film overall i enjoyed the entire first two hour being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study the film run like a well built clock slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax and an unpredictable one at that and then you settle in for a nice resolution which doe not occur it wa at this point that i felt cheated taking u on a terror ride of intrigue we follow kevin lomax around a he is the centerpiece of the film everything occurs from his perspective he is our representation on screen sort of but we are forced to witness a conclusion which make most of the film seem like a game i don t want to spoil the ending so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil s advocate is the extreme amount of everything it earned it r rating for a reason there is plenty of nudity sex violence gore and then you have gore violence sex and more nudity this film really isn t subtle about anything showing u everything it actually surprise me that this film did not receive an nc rating a it is quite harsh however the movie doe have it merit and nudity and sex are among those i don t condone sex and nudity in film but if it there i might a well enjoy it the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch the confrontation between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining but what stand out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife mary ann portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron mary ann s problem are incredibly intense and i found myself wanting to witness her decline this may sound uncaring but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her she is the most interesting character on the screen who is forced into a world where she is not wanted something the devil s advocate contained actually shocked me for reason other than extreme violence and nudity especially for a film of this nature the story actually ha something to say about humanity in one of the last scene john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god play with his child he is satan of course he comment that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity then god set up rule which contradict human nature this semi religious bashing is more humorous than frightening what milton say is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud partially thinking it wa funny but patially realizing it wa true these moral dilemma are present throughout the devil s advocate giving it an added depth many film skip over in their writing but i m sure they came straight from the novel it wa based on when a film ha something to say about our society it deserves to be watched the cast of the devil s advocate is one of the highlight a we see memorable face and they put spin on those memorable face we don t expect heather matarazzo make a brief appearance a the terrorized victim in the opening court case and she doe a great job probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reef he ha proven himself an uneven actor success such a speed and bomb such a johnny mnemonic but he top himself with this performance i have never seen him more believable to date al pacino is of course the scene stealer his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson the witch of eastwick and max von sydow needful thing he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scene but he remains completely believable if that is the correct term jeffrey jones mostly known a the principal in ferris bueller s day off also give a good performance a eddie barzoon judith ivey manages a credible performance a the mother who hold a secret to kevin s past connie nielson is very effective in her role and she also appears naked several time one familiar face with a twist wa coach star craig t nelson who give a very good performance the devil s advocate is rated r for sexuality nudity violence language and some gore at minute this film move along fairly quickly for the first two hour i sat completely engaged in the good performance and strong character the technical quality is also remarkable with great special effect and a good musical score director taylor hackford ha managed to create a very disturbing motion picture only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minute i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film and hackford gave me just that for a long time but just before the end he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream personally i would have preferred it ending fifteen minute early\n",

      "Sentence: one of the more unusual and suggestively violent film ever made seen is just a few step away from brilliance however those few step away are only a few step from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discus the film received mixed review upon release but there s an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critic perhaps did not notice at time it get preachy about the horror it seems to be criticizing but the script and the ultimate pay off are excellent the shocking conclusion is just a unpredictable a the ending of most film are predictable this piece of work is intensity it s uncomfortable to watch yet compelling i want not to look yet i can not turn away the story creep along slowly and deliberately crafted by visionary director david fincher he ha experience in tantalizing his audience with information and vision but not giving away too much too soon this is the guy who directed the ominous alien seen is even more ominous because the threat is real it s human and while the script take some artistic licence the way in which the diabolical killer work here is actually realistic that is if a human being could be so intelligent patient wealthy and disillusioned after the most bizarre opening credit i ve ever seen refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment the initial character development take place morgan freeman star a detective william somerset a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society brad pitt co star a detective david mill the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guy these two fine actor give the film it human quality along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow who play tracy mill wife however none of them stand out above the material no disrespect intended but two other actor could have played these part and the film probably would have been about the same an ironic note is that somerset ha only a week or that s seven day left on the force to train his young protege the title of the picture also refers to the deadly sin a chronicled by john milton in paradise lost gluttony greed sloth lust pride envy wrath incidentally i wrote the sin in order of how each victim wa found it s the last two sin that are the most intriguing and shocking but i won t give that away a i said this ha a great ending and no one should spoil it anyway the brilliant killer set out to make a statement to the world that these sin will no longer be tolerated and he make the sinner suffer for it the two partner stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man they learn that he wa murdered forced to eat himself to death the killer leaf small clue at this and other murder and of course somerset and mill are smart enough to stay with him all the way if they didn t it would be one short movie the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story we see a lot of blood but it s not especially violent the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown like most of the violence in pulp fiction seen is gory graphic and disturbing but all the gore is post death still if you tend to get queasy don t eat food during this film kevin spacey play john doe the avenging angel who claim that he s the messenger who will right the wrong with his teaching like many crazy men he ha some fine idea but some sick way of expressing himself spacey doesn t appear until the final minute and also doesn t receive billing in the opening credit however it s his appearance that turn this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not this character is so well written that it s hard to disagree when he say that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone no serial killer ha ever been so creative seen is blatantly unsubtle with it message about the horror of the world and it s often a little too depressing what it lack in those area it make up for with believable dialogue top notch screenwriting unexpected twist and realistic character the technical aspect of the film are unobtrusive fincher us lighting music and editing quite well but his story is always the thrust of the film fortunately we don t find out what happens to mill and somerset after the closing credit which are run backwards up the screen it s better to imagine what path they will follow this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget it s got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing the evil of the world aren t going to cure themselves seen raise some tough question and it s intelligent enough to allow it audience to answer many of those question for themselves useless trivia co star in s seen brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the best supporting actor oscar pitt in monkey spacey in the usual suspect for which he won\n",

      "Sentence: it s tough to really say something nice about a type of person who s so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone but by god american history x doe it and for that i commend it it not only take ball but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo nazi skinhead a kind of person who dedicates their life to hating anyone who s not what they are and this film wisely and miracurously pull it off the subject of this film is one of them but he is worse than one of the blind follower that make up most skinhead member since he is the leader of the pack he s the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage and then in another brilliant stroke justifies it with political propoganda that make eerie sense when he speaks he s so utterly convincing a a public speaker and so firm in his conviction that it come a a shock when he actually go through the rehabilitation process his name is derek vinyard and he s played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he s almost a convincing and arresting a public speaker a say malcom x when we first see him he s clean shaven with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast a devlish goatee and he s attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxer and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullet at least when he doesn t need them he so belief in his conviction that he s willing to put his belief to the test even if he know it will mean a stop in prison if only for a couple year american history x is about derek how he became a neo nazi skinhead how he rose to power how he wa rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that wa less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself and how he tried to save others namely his younger brother from making the same mistake we see him at all of these stage a a smart teenager a vicious hate monger a man having an epiphany and the man who try to correct what he s done before and in all of these we get a portrait of a man from all side or at least that s the intention the film s framing device is his brother danny edward furlong perpetually looking about also now a skinhead and how his principal bob sweeney avery brook who i just found out wa or is the captain on star trek s deep space is trying to correct him when the film open danny ha just written a book report on mein kampf landing him in trouble with sweeney which cause him to make him write a paper on derek s life and how it ha gotten him nowhere coincidentally this day is the day derek is released from prison and when we see him he s cleaned up not a buff and ha a full head of hair he s just a intelligent but still very rough along the edge but he s wisened up he s no longer controlled by his anger at black and jew and try to persuade danny who s becoming what derek wa before to give up his lifestyle but danny won t he go to a large skinhead beer bash meet with the skinhead leader stacy keach and then discovers that derek is a opposed to neo nazi dom a he wa for it a couple of year ago the film circle around this then spin off into non linear flashback all done in black and white we mostly see derek at his prime a a skinhead living in venice beach organizing vicious and quasi sadistic raid on local store that no longer hire the white middle class teenager since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrant to do the same work and mouthing off his theory on affirmative action and how illegal immigrant and black have destroyed the fundamental this country wa built on to them the white man is the one who ha gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop and he not only speaks elloquently forcefully and intelligently but he back everything up with political reason justifying their rage at least to them and frighteningly enough much of what he say sound true american history x is a collection of really great scene and moment rather than a cohesive great film that flow effortlessly from one moment to the next in it there are some of the best scene i ve seen all year one scene feature a dinner between derek s family and his mother s newest boyfriend played with reserve by eliott gould a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek s rightist view launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that build unparalled emotion in the audience gould s reaction to derek s final summation is unnerrving another scene us humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co worker guy torry while folding laundry in prison and another soon to be classic is actually divided in two the murder of the two black men that wind derek in jail which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year there s much more to appreciate like the acting which is uniformly good with stand out coming from avery brook beverly d angelo a the long suffering mother and gould who ha one horrible line but other than that come off with the best performance he s given in what seems like a really long time norton walk off with the film though coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble in only the fifth movie of his career norton ha invented himself a one of the most reliable and intense actor of his generation and maybe the best there s nothing like it when norton really get rolling in this movie spewing out line with such authority that he command all attention from the audience coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando that he allows the little emotion to seep through is amazing sadly enough this isn t going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hope to be it s too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off a either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece the ending especially is pencilled in from other movie tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon some of the skinhead are reduced to mere cliche kevin smith regular ethan suplee fair rather annoyingly a the fat skinhead whose line consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more and even the dramatic arc isn t a well travelled furlong s danny never seems to really be learning a lesson since the flashback refuse to show his point of view and when he decides to make a change by the end which wa inevitable it doesn t seem like it ha actually arrived there even derek s descent into skinhead dom doesn t seem justified though his fireman father william rus the dad from boy meet world and don t ask me how i know that is killed by a black junkie and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his belief a such one can see why the director tony kaye wanted to have his name removed sorta american history x is a very good movie and i wa very moved by it but it could be a lot better and the problem seems to be that the cut a it is is not up to what he claim to be his potential somewhere he claim there lie a tony kaye cut and that wa to be the true cut until it wa viewed by norton who then ordered another cut and that is thus although he aimed for the directing credit to go to alan smithee the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by it director it wasn t allowed to him under the ground that once you disown a film you can not badmouth it but really that s the macguffin no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval kaye s right in that it s not up to par even if he s not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par this will not be a do the right thing for the late s yet it still get it point across intelligently and back it up with it story it message that one can not be so enwrapped in one s own belief or pain and suffering will occur is literally said over the narration unfortunately and even if it isn t perfect at least when avery brook turn to norton after he ha been beaten and raped in prison and asks him if anything he s done ha made his life any better it realy hit a nerve not only in derek but also in the audience\n",

enjoy this movie the producer are not stupid making a movie just for fan of the series is not profitable you have to reach for a larger audience therefore the movie is quite user friendly altough non fan will only fail to understand certain emotion behind the look many character exchange but fear not duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on you will never feel a if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera in any case the answer is no i am not a fan of the file i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium however since the fox network a been so kind a to air several key episode for several week before the movie s opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie i taped all of these episode and watched them only after seing the movie i am glad to report that i learned nothing new everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie warning major spoiler follow please do not read to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming what exactly is over that hill and what that weird hummm sound is all about you have been warned the file is what a summer should be exciting scary great special effect unlike other summer movie the effect do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary and good performance this is coming from a guy who think david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank from start to finish this movie doe not let go of you when i compare it with last summer s movie the best way to describe it would be take the excitement and great score from face off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon this flick is scary not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our hero in fact the first time the critter in this movie make an apperance it is totally out of the blue you might a well bring ear plug because this thing is louuuudd the last time a monster scared me that much wa when i first saw alien a a six year old kid you know when you are affraid to put your foot on the floor because the creature might be under the chair or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt so yeah the x file is scary and guess what you never even have to see the monster but your imagination work overtime and it sure beat having to watch a flawed computer generated babyzilla it look like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster do not think that the file is a monster movie in fact the creature is there for maybe three minute total no the file is definately a mulder episode of the series scully is at his side of course but gillian anderson get maybe half the screen time she ha a couple of good scene with duchovny but she get kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she doe not get to do much no this is mulder s time in the spotlight by now you have heard of the scene where mulder shower independence day if you have not then i will not spoil it for you let s just say that due to recent event mulder should be showering godzilla instead to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there who care if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our hero so we feel a if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill the script is spotless every thing that happens happens for a purpose if you are confused by something do not worry because it will all become clear later on but and i can not stress this enough pay attention unlike most summer movie the dialogue is twice a important a the effect miss one vital piece of information and like most people who talk during movie you will go home and tell all your friend how this movie made no sense also to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movie don t the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation there is no time to take a breather between scene because again unlike most summer movie godzilla anybody the file doe not need to fill scene between the suspense and the action with useless subplots every scene is crucial and serf a purpose who need to see the blond chiouaoua have a big emotional scene between godzilla attack so far this summer i have seen only one movie who rank higher on my list of movie i d recommend and that is the truman show but it only win by a nose but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie the x file is what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited cool effect it s got some pulse pounding hell yes strangely enough i think that fan of the series will hate this movie while non fan will have a good time it doe not provide answer to the show s many question the status quo remains nearly the same and no mulder and scully do not get together rating four and a half out of five star for the best movie yet this summer several jump right out of your seat thrill many whoah i never saw that one coming moment four holy shit where the hell did that come from and one heck of an ending you may wonder where this movie lost half a star well i swore never to give a movie the full five star so i had to find something about the in his ice truck the track it leaf in the snow behind him go on for several mile but then they just stop it s pretty obvious the film s maker drove the truck for several mile to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time but in the end it look like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving\n",

they seem walter is a vet a stuck in vietnam a the dude is in the sixty everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam when a fellow bowler cross the foul line but won t admit it walter pull a gun on him until he mark a zero on the score sheet donny get precious few word in between walter s screaming and the dude s rambling when he doe walter shout him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling pun donny is out of his league and doesn t have a frame of reference the film is peppered with people for whom the term character would be an understatement the big

buscemi ha a limited role but he play it perfectly the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he s one of the treasure of our time it s odd to think that most of the world know him only a roseanne barr s television husband more like the coen s raising arizona than their hit fargo the big lebowski demand an open mind and even more open eye a mark of the coen brother is that even with all wonderful dream sequence and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss there s so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it walking out of the theater i felt that the film had something important to say on further examination i wasn t sure exactly what it wa if you meet jesus at the bowling alley it s not going to be what you expect when the going get weird the weird go bowling maybe there s no real message perhaps it s just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world maybe that s enough michael redman

      "Sentence: glory starring matthew broderick denzel washington and morgan freeman is the true story of the th regiment of massachusetts the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war broderick play robert gould shaw the young white officer who led the black soldier into battle shaw the son of well to do abolitionist hailed from boston high society the letter he wrote home to his parent during the war are on display at harvard and were evidently the inspiration for glory a the film begin in shaw is a captain in the northern force like private eriksson michael j fox in casualty of war shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war that is until his company is attacked by enemy force shaw experience first hand the horror and chaos of battle witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet graz his neck soon after his recovery shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train black in the war effort glory is the story not only of colonel shaw but also of the black soldier who laid down their life to free their brother from slavery the film periodically jump between shaw s point of view and the perspective of the black soldier the movie introduces u to a handful of black recruit and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action the large black cast is uniformly outstanding especially washington who is electrifying a a runaway slave with a big mouth he is brash and pushy always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight his bitter tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability washington provides much of the film s intensity and emotional power in one heartbreaking scene he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army when he remove his shirt to receive the punishment you cringe at the sight of his back which is riddled with ugly scar from his day a a slave it make your blood boil the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings a tear roll down washington s cheek and will probably run down your cheek a well the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn t deserting the army at all he left camp to look for shoe because his foot were covered with oozing sore freeman is a usual a strong presence even in a small supporting role he play a grave digger who ha buried more white soldier than he care to remember he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldier holding the group together and serving a a liaison to the white officer colonel shaw recognizes freeman s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major making him the first black officer in the army andre braugher make an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles a free black who is one of shaw s close childhood friend searles is educated and refined like a white man prompting washington to nickname him snow flake the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat the road from marching drill to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment the soldier suffer innumerable hardship but somehow they never lose their morale the army treat the black soldier like second class citizen subjecting them to racism and discrimination they are paid only a month whereas their white counterpart earn thirteen and for a long time they have to go without shoe gun or uniform to make matter worse the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the black into action preferring instead to use them for manual labor eventually however the regiment receives it boot uniform rifle and right to fight thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw shaw ha absolute faith in his soldier and he fight tooth and nail to get them what they deserve even if it mean threatening a general with blackmail broderick in fact is most convincing in the scene where shaw stand up for the regiment unfortunately however broderick s uneven performance is in many respect the weak link in the movie in an effort to look more mature broderick sport a mustache and a goatee and throughout the film he slip in and out of a phony boston accent he is never altogether convincing a shaw since much of the time his emotion seem forced the film place too much weight on broderick s character and not enough on the black soldier who are more intriguing glory regains lost ground with it harrowing depiction of war the movie show the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july glory doe not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and gut except for a few bullet wound and one exploding head the film for the most part leaf the gore to your imagination which is not to say that the battle scene in glory are timid to the contrary they are chaotic and horrifying it s just that director edward zwick the co creator of thirtysomething film them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldier the movie depicts some of but not enough of their custom and ritual in one scene for example the soldier motivate themselves by singing prayer around the campfire each man ha a chance to relay a few word of inspiration a couple of the movie s most touching moment involve young black child looking up to the black soldier with awe disbelief and pride the regiment s greatest triumph come when the soldier distinguish themselves in battle thereby earning the respect of their white peer and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner like any war film glory ha it share of gloom and despair but ultimately it prof to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson a valuable reminder that despite what the history book say or more precisely what they do not say black played a critically important role in the north s victory over the south forever changing the evolution of america\n",

      "Sentence: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned it s rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minute of finn taylor s first feature film dream with the fish when the plodding tedious opening sequence finally pay off with a potentially provocative setup any hopeful expectation however are soon vanquished a the film settle upon being an uninvolving mismatched buddy movie which is rarely a funny a it aspires to be nor nearly a affecting a it eventually strives to be in the film s latter half the film s central character are terry david arquette a depressed lonely voyeur who claim to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident and nick brad hunt a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill nick life in the apartment building across from terry who spy on the tryst between nick and girlfriend liz kathryn erbe with his trusty set of binoculars but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half drunk terry precariously teeter upon the edge unconvincingly vowing suicide nick casually asks for terry s wristwatch and eventually con terry into a trade the watch for a bottle of pill of course terry find that the pill do not end up having the presumed lethal effect and he angrily set out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch learning of nick s condition he only ha a handful of week left terry s compassion kick in and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick s lifelong fantasy and nick will fulfill terry s death wish by killing him this is a promising premise and mr taylor s film could have gone any number of ambitious way from this point but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the character terry is a repessed mournful character who want to die while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but want to live and take the easy route out by turning dream with the fish into a typical lark where the two character engage in a series of generally dull exploit and where the straight laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character this is by the number plotting buddy movie road movie redux however dream with the fish is most hampered not by it uninspired storyline but by the character which carry the story it help in such a film to have at least one of the protagonist be at least somewhat empathetic if not likeable unfortunately that is not the case here where both of the film s leading character are thorougly uninteresting and annoying giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plight and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploit far from a romp this fatal flaw make dream with fish more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt and undermines the attempt at emotional resonance in the latter stage of the film a the two men begin to bond mr taylor s dialogue sporadically fall flat in dream with the fish while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone it too often come across instead a hopelessly contrived witness such line a you should have asked something more interesting like do you enjoy the pain see that s provocative leaf room for further question the film enjoys a few inspired moment the urn scene a session of nude bowling the policeman joining in on terry and nick s acid trip but unfortunatetely these instance are few and far between and for the most part the humour in dream with the fish register more a attempt rather than actual success this occurs particularly often during the film s opening sequence a terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital i m realising that this is intended to be funny although nary a smile crept upon my lip which is probably due to the obvious fact that it s painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempt sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick s scheme of tricking him this is not a film which ha the wherewithal to kill off it leading star in the opening ten minute the entire sequence is then clearly an exercise for character exposition with attempt at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability among the cast coming off best is david arquette the current master in the portrayal of meek squirming stammering fresh faced character he would have been terrific a the lead for george huang s swimming with shark who get to apply his adeptness for timidity a terry mr taylor ambitiously employ an interesting visual technique where the portion of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated a opposed to a bright crisp look for the smalltown scene the charge of dream with the fish s protagonist being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me i seem to have a predilection for film with unlikeable character and indeed in many case have i been in the minority supporting film which have been condemned a interminable due to the difficult audience unfriendly nature of their character for dream with the fish though i did find myself on the flip side of coin often hoping that the film would quickly conclude and that the nick character would just hurry up and die\n",

darkness eye shooting dagger quietly blaming me for the fact that they paid hard earned money to spend their time watching this this thing i shift uncomfortably in my seat i m reminded of how i feel when i see a pair of second or third rate celebrity engaging in a teleprompted funny conversation to introduce the next blockbuster award it s not my fault i know it s not my fault but dammit someone s got ta be embarrassed because it doesn t look like anyone on the screen is ready to take the blame i m about to give you a list of name of people who are gon na make a movie together garry shandling annette bening john goodman greg kinnear mike nichols do any of these name make you instantly shudder the answer i would have come up with before today is no this is quite a list of talented individual we ve got here granted john goodman wa in the flintstone and greg kinnear ha turned in some less than lackluster leading man performance in certified failure like a smile like yours but even so they ve got proven power a excellent supporting player garry shandling ha two television classic under his belt his ingenious little it s garry shandling s show and the larry sander show and for god s sake mike nichols directed the graduate and annette bening is just walking away from american beauty so explain this this thing what planet are you from purport to be a comedy exploring the relationship between men and woman satirizing the whole pop psychology mar venus phenomenon but what this movie wind up being is a collection of unfunny cringe inducing moment coupled with uninsightful cringe inducing moment the end result is unsurprisingly an unfunny uninsightful cringe inducing thoroughly icky embarrassment garry shandling play an alien from a planet populated by technologically advanced but emotionally vacant male they reproduce through cloning of course his leader put a select group of male through a series of test designed to determine which one is most fit to fly off to earth find a female of the specie and impregnate her they re taught how to pretend that they re listening by nodding and saying uh huh and how to compliment shoe imagine my delighted surprise when oh heaven all their carefully practiced tactic turn out to fail miserably producing comedic result the lucky winner is fitted with a penis since theirs after generation of disuse have long since shrunk out of existence i will restrain myself from mentioning the implausibility of such a scenario since the population ha stopped evolving due to the fact that they re all just clone whoop too late the penis when aroused tends to make a humming noise the writer when frequently strapped for idea tend to turn to this a a source of comedy it isn t funny the first time it isn t funny the eighth time it isn t funny the eighteenth time if anything it made me feel vaguely self conscious garry meet up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear who turn out to be a generic unlikable scumbag he s meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling s alien character but he s so flatly drawn that even the writer quickly give up and toss him aside kinnear s scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claim other people work a his own to worm his way into a vice president position and go to aa meeting to pick up chick wow what a magnificent bastard nearly every man in the movie in fact is played a the same sort of sex driven slimeball when kinnear s wife walk into the office there isn t a single guy who doesn t trip bump into a wall or otherwise pratfall a if they d never seen a woman before the few guy that aren t particularly slimeballs such a john goodman s detective character are simply uncommunicative workaholic shandling meet up with annette bening who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed at one of kinnear s aa meeting shandling s mission is to have a baby and when he reveals his desire to her bening instantly fall for him and the next day they get married yup the next day cuz ya see it turn out she want a baby too bening s character perhaps wa the most difficult to watch especially after seeing her come apart at the seam so effectively in american beauty if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the specie a a whole then woe i say to the specie she s unfathomably insecure and succumbs so easily to all of shandling s line and lie that it border on tragic there s a point where after thinking she may not be able to bear child she learns that she is indeed pregnant when garry come home after nearly cheating on her she stroll into the kitchen and sings high hope you know the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song to deliver the news and then say to him now you can t leave me we re supposed to empathize with shandling s discovery of the feeling of guilt but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she wa placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing and eventually shandling fall in love with her for real i suppose though i m not sure exactly what prompted it what s the message i derive from all this men are liar inherently empty creature but if you hang around long enough well maybe something will click ha ha ha i m thankful such broad cynicism isn t frequently allowed to run so rampant let s all join hand and pray that the planet these folk are from is not this one there s also a subplot involving john goodman a an airline incident investigator that wade in the bog of stupidity goodman through a series of astoundingly implausible realization put together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic vibrating penis it ha all the making for a subplot of having shandling be discovered that thankfully never come to the inevitable hackneyed fruition instead it just dangles limply on the branch for a while withers and fall away further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brother movie but let s not dwell on this any longer i ve already wasted plenty of your time and my own let s move on forget about what we ve seen here and get on with our life and to help u out let s end thing on a happy note congratuations go out to annette bening winner of this week s title award for delivering the awkward line of dialog containing the movie s name\n",

and saturday night wallet in hand the formula is very simple you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal you add a high school environment that feature everyone from prom queen to math club nerd and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in minute the typical teenage attention span the response is enormous a this part of the population will waste it money on almost any film set in an environment they can relate to and most importantly they dont care to judge film quality so any piece of trash will due that is just what never been kissed the latest film from director raja gosnell is trash josie geller drew barrymore is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun time she ha her own personal assistant unlimited supply and her own office but she is very much dismayed with her position in life there is nothing she want more than to be a reporter and go out into the field where she can play a more active role in the chicago medium so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere she jump at it with elation constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita molly shannon and her amicable superior gu john c reilly the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment a they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter however since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minute and josie is headed for the field obviously the field assignment involves a high school specifically she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school by enrolling in the senior class and becoming one of them i dont think that i need to even begin to explain all the impossibility of this situation ever occurring so i wont the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school interwoven flashback scene show u just how much of a dork she truly wa and she appears to be heading down that road again fortunately for this lame production other character do appear that make some of these high school scene both humorous and remotely interesting they include the predictable love story between both a student jeremy jordan and a teacher michael vartan to show that josie is really two people in one body also her younger brother and opposite rob david arquette come into her new found life and even cause a rare scene that is mildly provocative the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing typical for teenage film it is chalk full of sexual innuendo and condom humor one scene in particular feature a certain classroom activity involving banana and latex that is absolutely hysterical most of the other joke are straight forward high school humor that anyone who ha ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy but those still dont recover for the total lack of quality in this movie following this trend of high school movie rule come the general acting it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film in this case drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch she is required to play her character on two level having some very black and white transition and although some scene are written to be particular shade of gray she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel and is expected to him on an adult level since he is one her teacher but she never seems to get out of the gray area and in doing so she make a mockery out of his otherwise good performance following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon saturday night live she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to and draw the attention of an audience a simply unrealistic it is these quality that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film david arquette scream take home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic and not have his brilliant acting ruined and a a central character he get to take on his own mini plot which is one of the few well done part of never been kissed in a dazzling cherry on the sundae type piece of work he doe an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the hit risky business never been kissed is a mediocre film at best the predictable plot ha become so overplayed in hollywood that it is sickening to watch time and again and this film is no exception the acting is just a bad but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light unfortunately the bottom line is that the movie will be a success because teenager will pay to see any trash\n",

pernilla august frank oz ahmed best kenny baker anthony daniel screenplay george lucas producer rick mccallum runtime min u distribution th century fox rated pg mild violence thematic element copyright nathaniel r atcheson a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review i ve attempted to obey this rule in recent month but to do so would be impossible in this case the fact is nearly every person who go to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them the original star war trilogy mean so much to so many people for me they calibrated my creativity a a child they are masterful original work of art that mix moving story with what were astonishing special effect at the time and they still hold up pretty darn well i am too young to have seen star war in the theater during it original release but that doesn t make me any less dedicated to it on the contrary the star war trilogy and the empire strike back in particular are three item on a very short list of why i love movie when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine film series i got exited when i first saw screenshots from the film well over a year ago i embarked on a year long drool of anticipation and when the first preview were released last thanksgiving i wa ready to see the film but then there wa the hype the insane marketing campaign and lucasfilm s secretive snobbery over the picture in the last week before the picture opened while multitude of fan waited outside of theater and stood in the boiling sun day in advance just to be the first one in the theater i wa tired of hearing about it i wa tired of seeing cardboard cut out of the character whenever i went to kfc or taco bell i just wanted to see the movie reader do not misunderstand i did not have an anti hype reaction the hype wa unavoidable i understand and accept the hype it s just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved film of all time get released five minute into the phantom menace i knew there wa a problem who are these jedi knight i asked why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine gun rapidity why aren t these character being developed before their adventure why is there a special effect shot in nearly every frame of the entire film these were just some of my question early on later i asked where s the magic of the first three film and why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minute by the end of the film i wa tired maddened and depressed george lucas ha funneled his own wonderful movie into a pointless mindless summer blockbuster the phantom menace is no star war film take away the title and the jedi talk and the force and you re left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effect movie of all time it s an embarrassment i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored or a new theme is examined or a special effect shot isn t used there are a few of each but they re all token attempt the fact is george lucas ha created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effect this is not what i wanted to see i didn t want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth but i did the story center mostly around qui gon jinni liam neeson looking lost and confused and his apprentice obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor who scarcely ha a line in the film and their attempt to liberate the people of the planet naboo naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation their contact on naboo is queen amidala natalie portman the teenage ruler who truly care for her people after picking up jar jar binks a completely cgi character voiced by ahmed best they head to tatooine where they meet young anakin skywalker jake lloyd and his mother pernilla august qui gon know that the force is strong with young anakin and so the jedi knight take the boy with them on their journey the bad guy are darth maul and darth sidious neither of whom have enough line to register a character there isn t anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form the way lucas ha handled it however it unsatisfactory first of all we don t learn one single thing about qui gon jinni not one thing what wa his life like before this film well i imagine he didn t have one that s why he feel like a plot device this probably explains why neeson look so hopeless in the role and why he s recently retired from film i don t blame him honestly obi wan a character i wa really looking forward to learning more about is even less interesting mcgregor ha just a few line so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace lucas ha served u a big emotional void a the centerpiece of his movie thing start to pick up when our character reach tatooine young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed out character in the film and lloyd doe a thoughtful job with the role i wa also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting and when anakin say goodbye to his mother i found it moving also fairly good is portman and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth ha been written jar jar binks is one of the most annoying character i ve ever had to endure but he s more interesting than most of the human a soon a the relatively brief segment on tatooine is over it s back to the mind numbing special effect and depthless action scene i ve seen many movie that qualify a special effect extravaganza but the phantom menace is the first one i ve seen that had me sick of the special effect fifteen minute into the movie the reason is obvious george lucas ha no restraint i can t say that i didn t find the effect original because i did the final battle between darth maul obi wan and qui gon is visually exceptional a is most of the film but i also found the effect deadening and tiresome my breaking point wa near the end of the picture a anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi master in the background we see hundred of digital spaceship flying around through a digital sky and i wanted that to go away can t we have one stinking scene that isn t bursting at the seems with a special effect shot i got so sick of looking at the cgi character and spaceship and planet and background that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hour and then there s the question of magic what wa lost in the sixteen year between the phantom menace and return of the jedi i have a feeling that lucas wa so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel john williams familiar score is no help nor is lucas direction i think it come right down to character there are none here i longed for the magnetic presence of han luke and leia but i got no such thing and what about the ridiculous expectation mine weren t that high i simply wanted a film that showed me the root of the film that i grew up loving a story that had a few character and a few great special effect instead i got two hour and fifteen minute of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphic show i don t hate the phantom menace a much a i resent it i d like to forget that it exists and yet i can t it s here to stay i can only hope that episode ii and iii have something of substance in them because if they don t then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series\n",

      "Sentence: martial art master steven seagal not to mention director ha built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial art superman who never get hurt in fight talk in a hushed tone and squint at any sign of danger he s also the most consistent individual in hollywood today since all his movie suck they basically represent his egotisitical tendency about his art that is martial art i m sure the guy s good and he seems like a nice guy on talk show although a tad haughty but these movie he make are all the same a guy who is basically indestructable is maybe wounded supposedly mortally then come back with a vengeance and go buddha on all the baddie ass although i kinda liked under siege of course this one a a change ha a message that is drilled into our mind of course after he blow up a lot of stuff and kill a bunch of people so why do i watch his crap i usually don t i will never and you can hold me to this i will never pay to see this man s movie unless and only unless he s in a supporting role i e executive decision and i d definitely pay if he dy i e executive decision but this one ha a special place in my heart this doesn t mean it s good or that i even liked it this wa the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la mystery science theatre and this wa a couple year before i had heard of mystery science theatre in this one seagal play a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased up typical shallow villain this time played by an oscar winner to give the movie some more clout michael caine it seems that caine want to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land around the minute point seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs what with his new fire down below another message film and caine ha him bumped off or doe he seagal is rescued by some inuit and fall in love with one of them played by joan chen who can act hypothetically but for some reason not here one of caine s cliched henchman played here with a lot of overacting by john c mcginley shoot the cheif of the inuit clan and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory literally of course at one point seagal give a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn t have any option but blow stuff up he even go a far a to say i don t want to kill someone and in the same breath he asks some guy where the arsenal is i have no problem with violence i m a huge john woo fan but he paint his film with suspense skill style depth characterization and just plain cool violence in the film of seagal the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly and him either wounding or killing them at some point they use the cliche of the talking villain where the villain ha the advantage can shoot seagal but begin talking by either telling him his big secret plan or saying a corny line to which seagal say something hokey back and ha had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them and doe this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn t take itself seriously at all like in the case of this summer s con air but seagal is serious about his skill and of course his message i wouldn t mind if this wa a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence but seagal ha no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle not pounded into the viewer s mind the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish thus we can t take him and his motif seriously and while seagal talk about being kind to the environment he also go ahead and blow up a square mile of rig and kill some worker who were just doing his job then at the end he spends a good minute giving a speech just in case you didn t get the message from the trailer what seagal doesn t realize is that no one take his film seriously although maybe a couple do and any message he ha is no only redundant but doesn t comfortably fit in his film which is filled to the brim with hokey violence crap suspense stupid melodrama and character who have about a much emotional depth a a petri dish a far a seagal and his acting he s rather boring he squint he kill period nothing else oh yeah there s corny one liner i m gon na reach out and touch someone of course he s the star and we re supposed to root for him and all so he make all the villain unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerk michael caine who s a great actor is just supposed to yell and look cold he doe it well i guess but this is no alfie of coure no one wa expecting that caliber of performance from him his big henchman john c mcginley is kinda boring a well but is not horrible and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeant on celluloid r lee ermey from full metal jacket a a hired assasin squad leader who get to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is just for the movie trailer and for seagal s ego and also look for billy bob thornton a one of ermey s assasins anyway to conclude this all to judge one of seagal s movie is to judge all of them except for under siege and executive decision though the latter is not really a seagal movie they all have this same formula they all have the same action same villain same plot but this one ha that message which make it more excrucitating to watch i mean if you do rent it and i don t reccomend you do make sure you just skip the last minute but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad that the last film i viewed with my uncle wa a pleasurable one my extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock\n",

wichita where the company ha paid all their expense for them to rent a hospitality suite on the th floor of the hotel where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna someone named dick fuller who is the head of a big industrial corporation he is someone they have never met before but they want to sell him industrial lubricant and they want desperately to land this new account it is their only reason for coming to the convention the big kahuna revel in salesman talk among the three white christian male two of them larry spacey and phil devito who are veteran salesman having teamed together for the last twelve year while bob facinelli is a young man who ha just recently been hired by the firm and work in the research department these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna a the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interaction in the hospitality suite the three salesman have different thing on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job and they are each going through internal change that are profoundly altering their life the outstanding cast try to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why what come into question is their opinion on life and death on god and morality and on how they make a living these are tough question and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sale pitch their dialogue is acerbic witty and analytical following in the long tradition of salesman film from death of a salesman the tin men and glengarry glen ross a this film try to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that get these men high in this case it is landing the big kahuna they each are trying to see why he s on top and why they are chasing after him what make this film different than the others is it blatant religious message comparing orthodox religion to what they do a both must sell their product and how after each one s psyche is stripped clean by the other there is a pause and some lesson about life ha sunk in that is pertinent to each the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna but in finding out what bill of good they sold themselves that made them be salesman larry and phil have one way of doing thing and have no qualm of incorporating a sale pitch a part of their life bob think he is above the fray and he pitch every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his action the word of jesus he literally belief in bob is a baptist who take a very non questioning and literal attitude about religion to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin according to the way he read the bible when asked by larry why he married his wife he seems puzzled and can t even say because he love her only that marriage is something sacred to him the contrast in their personality is stark larry is all business he simply want to close the sale he come into the room pumped for the convention using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman he criticizes phil for being so placid for getting such a small suite for having the cheap food tray of carrot stick rather than the one of stuffed shrimp and for being burned out he tell him to go on a vacation get a woman while phil is reflective on where all his best year have gone for him and is contemplating a career change now that he is and is painfully divorcing his wife after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long he now find himself suffering from some troubling dream and questioning what he belief in he ha always been a charmer shaking everyone s hand trying to please his client while trying to make the sale larry is more aggressive a a salesman he is always a heart attack away from every big sale in contrast bob is only in his twenty and everything seems fresh to him this is his first time for him on the road when dick fuller doesn t arrive at the party the salesman throw larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering when told that he spoke to the secretary larry throw a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account but when they start talking to bob whom they forced to act a the bartender they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but wa wearing another man s name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus bob then tell the boy about a private party fuller is attending afterwards and that he invited bob to attend larry and phil can t fathom how bob didn t make a sale pitch but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller s attention about their company s product a they sent him off to meet fuller and will await his return in the hotel room these two sharp salesman are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their as the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room a they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their life these three performer were outstanding each understanding what their role called for each coming through with a marvelous performance the only problem with the film is that it more of a play than a cinematic experience but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics give it an intelligent selling point and make it a

camera flow around the hard toiling men giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that end with our three hero ulysses everett mcgill george clooney delmar tim blake nelson and pete john

petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brain department but he seems like a genius when compared to the simple sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of million their odyssey take on the mystical proportion of homer s original material a they meet all manner of people along the way including those dangerous siren who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoal and a cyclops who beat them and take all their money there is magic too when delmar belief that pete wa turned into a horny toad by the siren the story

sightless radio station man and without their knowledge are recorded a they sing the traditional tune i am a man of constant sorrow it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and give u in my mind the best movie song of the year contrasting this and other wonderful moment the sexy seduction by the siren come to mind are some pretentious bit that detract from the overall quality of o brother in particular near the end is a scene where ulysses delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched the scene is overblown and flashy and reek of the wizard of oz they don t

funny charming a little dumb and one of the handsomest actor in the business today he ha the charm of a s movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situation with dignity ulysses ha an ongoing obsession with his hair risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnet his vanity will come to plague him a it would any mystical hero wanderer while clooney is the

church congregation in their mass baptism delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that make him shine the taciturn pete a played by longtime coen collaborator turturro is the sullen member of the trio and give them the necessary angst all together the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooge and the three musketeer a they

foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere in the exotic morocco of a year old english hippie mother julia winslet of two sweet young girl the year old lucy carrie and the year old bea bella ha arrived for a year s stay with the self absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughter might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband she is not officially married to him and her cold one room london flat and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech at least she say she is a she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who ha all the answer she ha not planned thing out too carefully having no money and the trip doesn t seem like it s much fun more like a misadventure with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in drug a world wide youthful phenomenon during this period where many westerner came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the good life cheaply and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authority even though drug are illegal there but this is not shown a one of her reason for being here in this film the subject of drug is never broached only hinted at in an off handed but slurring way a the hippie commune is shown in a negative light strumming on their guitar and bragging about the hit of acid they have taken even the one coming here for spiritual reason to follow the mystical sufi seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experience of sigmund freud s grand daughter esther freud who traveled here in the s with her mother and sister it is written by the director s brother who ha previously directed regeneration the playboy and trojan eddie the title of the film come from the squealing giggle that saying hideous kinky give the little girl with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria so instead she meet an acrobat street performer in the bazaar bilal said taghmaoui he becomes her lover taking the place of her husband a a father figure for the girl the girl readily accept him and there is no big to do made about their openly sexual relationship but the girl really don t know what to make of the relationship it especially bother bea who is embarrassed by her mother s loose attitude and want to go home thing go surprisingly sour when bilal take them to stay in his small village it seems only that bilal s charm is matched by his shiftlessness a he ha a wife who still life there this scene didn t make too much sense a to why he would take them there knowing the situation unless the uneducated man wa totally uneducated in the custom of his people also but i doubt that the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next a they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kill them when he fall asleep by the wheel lucy take it all in stride and ha a good disposition for travel while bea just want to go to a school and learn something and be a normal girl the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet a the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and it bustling street scene expansive view illustrious mosque and grand sunset kate enacts the feel of what it wa like to be a westerner living out the countercultural experience while awaiting to gather her sensibility again and wa fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experience a many a drop out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose the background music from group like america and jefferson airplane provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film the only hope wa that the two innocent girl would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves the family s travel which is on the edge ha julia waking up screaming from dream that are bleakly haunting but when she get up all there is is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her is starting to wear thin in her thought it will dawn on her when bea take ill a she reflects on what the sufi guru tell her whom she finally meet and is driven to tear in his presence he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him the new guru is grounded in reality something she is not grounded in and seems to tell her what she couldn t comprehend from anyone else even comforting her by telling her that her tear are memory a gift from god the film s weakness wa the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in it risk free tenor she wa there basically to be just escaping from her situation and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia the storyline about a helpless single parent detracted from the vibrant experience many others of her same baby boom generation had during their trip to morocco who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism a teaching that ha a lot to offer it follower contrary to the impression the film might give seemed to pas her by her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep at best she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kid along smoking some hashish and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn t have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey after all the mystical trip is the journey the film s strength is in how all the character are shown for what they are and no one is that good or that bad or judged too harshly for their shortcoming bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity the little girl are precocious but they are lovable julia the cornerstone the film is built on is a mother who care about the child but doesn t know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them she wa trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london she ha another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmare about where she s at this is a very freudian way to look at thing a this sudden realization that thing are not right put an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey at least for the time being and after all is said and done who s to say if the child are also not better off for surviving their experience just like she probably wa\n",

time you encounter a new person you ve just become part of a story everyone ha their own life story both past and present and every time two or more interact they become part of each others story not necessarily an important or even significant part but a part nevertheless that seems to be the basic theory behind go where several character chance encounter all effect each other in extreme way in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of character that wouldn t usually be the type to have an entire film revolve around them such a a teenage supermarket cashier a bottom of the drug food chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actor these type of character might not sound all that original but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father a mid level drug dealer a narc obsessed with multi level marketing horny wedding guest a zen lovemaker two shrimp scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round thing out how they will all come together is the process the film deal with i d imagine the concept to the film started out a the creator testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general the film start out a anything else with little indication of what s to come we meet ronna polley a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn t seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent she s not very charming especially to her customer but this is played mostly for laugh rather than characterization and it work maybe this is because she s not a very afeminite character but she s far from masculine a creative character indeed thing start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hour of the goofy hyperactive yet likable simon askew an english teen into vice for the sake of the experience this agreement start a three pronged storyline a it allows simon to go to la vega for the weekend with his friend and in turn drag ronna and her friend into buying and selling an experimental drug the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death nearly the same can be said for two other character zack mohr and adam wolf who we don t think much of when they first appear a supporting character but later will become major player to the film s makeup another process used by the filmmaker to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be once the pace is picked up the film really begin to show it mettle when the title screen ronna is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene it s clear this film isn t going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling considering how good it is up until that point it s a long overdue change of pace needed in movie today and so the film begin to take shape first by following ronna and her friend on a one night adventure that begin with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam who were actually looking for simon which doesn t exactly go a planned but that s what keep it all so interesting the second storyline start at the same moment a ronna s story but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead simon and his three friend head to vega for a night on the town and in the process experience thing they never would have imagined the third arc about zack and adam again overlap with ronna s story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle we re shown thing we never would have expected were going on while following ronna and many of the event that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren t even their fault they just happened to be where they were when they were i d really like to dissect each of the three storyline and especially how the film wrap up in the end but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven t seen the film perhaps the greatest element to the film is it constant surprise and unpredictability and not due to plot twist or a confusing screenplay just through great filmmaking still i can list and analyze nearly everything the film doe so well direction trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such a liman it s a great accomplishment he doesn t just depict a story he wrap u up in it all pulling u into the fray so that we experience every high and low screenplay besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general it s clear the script ha been inspired by many source with both obvious and subtle reference yet it never scream rip off tone mood where other hollywood film have failed to bring the charm of the independent to the mainstream this one is able to create it own sense of the macabre it s not overly dark or twisted and the comedy isn t so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy more like macabre light cinematography art direction able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner characterization for nearly every character introduced no matter what role they play in the big picture we re able to get a sense of who they are what they re thinking and how they came to be in their situation even when their action are surprising it never seems very out of synch performance every actor nail their role see above theme theory the film doesn t seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social message instead it s more of a philosophical experiment in fact it might not have meant to do that intentionally but there definitely is something existential to it all and to think that go is just a big comedy and adventure see also the big lebowski clerk jackie brown pulp fiction true romance also by liman swinger\n",

classic hitchcock with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry spiced tabasco sauce a dish not to everyone s taste but certainly a well crafted movie possibly that movie s greatest strength wa that the most important event happened offstage prior to the movie during the movie and after the movie and that after bringing all the plotlines together neatly it left the viewer with full knowledge of what would happen in the character future so there wa no need to film it there wa actually about four hour worth of screen story there but eszterhas found way to get it all on screen in two by leading his audience into analyzing what wa really going on and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trail the major element that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirl we have attractive sympathetic but still highly repellent character we have show for the eye and the ear plotlines that play on several level we have beautifully delineated character who are drawn from life and very believable and we have a story of an innocent who may not be so innocent who s trying to play straight trying to improve her station in life who slip into behaving the way those around her do but recovers with a flourish and quits a winner in this sense the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven who s not known for treating his character well but nomi the part played by elizabeth berkley definitely opts out of the game in a positive way and we re left feeling good about her future this is not one of the great movie but it s far better than we d been led to expect by all the negative pre release publicity verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in and in the last quarter century ha pushed farther and farther experimenting with the socially acceptable limit to movie making his most recent three movie robocop total recall and basic instinct have been a progression of back door access to american culture moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drive and now he s exploring the sleeze this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director s contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie verhoeven had to cut several part of basic instinct to get an r rating although his original version is available on video many reviewer have taken the politically correct stance that any movie which us naked lady a scenery is a bad thing but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked lady it s about people in an environment where naked lady are common and why such an environment should exist it s about the scum who use other people a power trip toy and the need to escape their power it s about a world where sex is nothing and normal human value don t pertain and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scene is something of an accomplishment an nc movie which isn t sexually exciting say a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex ha been robbed of any kind of beauty power or value the one scene in the movie that could have been a good sex scene berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool is not exciting because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator if anything it s a rape scene with a victim who s been duped into cooperation you don t make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actor you don t make a movie about world war ii without a few gun

      "Sentence: it ha been three long year since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival s palme d or a million plus box office gross and an oscar nomination all for his sophomore outing pulp fiction since then the talented film maker ha been virtually invisible surfacing briefly a a co director of the wildly uneven four room and the screenwriter of the gory vampire fest from dusk till dawn in between he ha moonlighted a an actor with several decidedly unmemorable performance now with much fanfare and anticipation tarantino ha returned with his third directorial effort jackie brown and while this motion picture adapted from elmore leonard s novel rum punch offer solid entertainment those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theater disappointed for the most part jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie the story which start out slowly develops into a twisty affair with double cross and triple cross and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademark witty dialogue unexpected gunfire s pop tune and close ups of womens bare foot yet for all of that the production is something of a letdown the sheer in your face exuberance that marked reservoir dog and especially pulp fiction is absent the mostly straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn t match up favorably to the non linear style of tarantino s previous effort an approach that added tension and edginess to the narrative and there aren t nearly a many deliciously offbeat conversation this time around there s a samuel l jackson monologue about gun a jackson chris tucker argument regarding the merit of hiding in a car trunk and a jackson robert niro exchange that recall some of the jackson travolta material from pulp fiction but that s about it jackie brown s lone innovation is it presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspective this isn t exactly an original technique it ha been done numerous time before most famously in akira kurosawa s rashomon and most recently in edward zwick s courage under fire however while in those two movie and others there wa a legitimate plot reason for the multiple point of view tarantino s sole purpose for using it appears to be because it s unconventional had the scene in question been shown from only one of the three vantage nothing would have been lost a a result this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity for the second picture in a row tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a s icon this time around instead of john travolta it s blaxploitation queen pam grier foxy brown ha become jackie brown in one of many nod to the most famous segment of grier s career tarantino us a s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credit there are also several instance during jackie brown when the director offer a sly wink towards certain convention of the blaxploitation genre although grier never doe any butt kicking grier is jackie brown a flight attendant who get caught transporting drug and money into the united state she s working for gun dealer ordell robbie samuel l jackson but she keep her mouth shut under questioning despite pressure from ray nicolet michael keaton a federal official no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie ordell arranges for a bail bondsman max cherry robert forster tv s banyon to post the necessary then plan to shoot jackie if she prof disloyal jackie pass ordell s test however and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle of ordell s money into the united state without tipping off the fed soon just about everyone is after that money including jackie max ray ordell s perpetually oversexed and drugged out girlfriend melanie bridget fonda and his right hand man louis robert de niro unsurprisingly the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l jackson but ordell isn t nearly a invigorating or compelling a character a jules from pulp fiction in addition to looking fantastic pam grier is also quite good although hers is not an oscar caliber performance although she might get a nomination robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough guy who rarely smile role bridget fonda is around for three discernible reason to look sexy in a bikini to provide a little twisted comedy and to satisfy tarantino s foot fetish robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy looking middle aged actor the film which clock in at several minute over the two and a half hour mark is probably too long for the material but the plot is convoluted enough to keep u guessing throughout although the payoff is a letdown tarantino keep thing moving along nicely with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction but on the whole this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabe than something from the director himself when it come to recent caper film like the grifter and bound jackie brown is a second tier effort it s an entertaining diversion but not a masterpiece and certainly not an oscar contender\n",

      "Sentence: one of the biggest cliche of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable you know the one where the detective look at a wall of picture and other police information and suddenly spot the clue which reveals who the killer is sure it s been used over and over but for some reason it is always fun to watch this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girl work on overused but always fun one of my personal rule about watching a film is not how original the film is but how it go around giving it story this rule applies highly to kiss the girl there is something psychologically stimulating in a well crafted serial killer movie and kiss the girl is certainly well made however the whole film scream of unoriginality and so it relies on the power of it actor and the technical detail to pull it through well not only are the actor capable of pulling it through but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up unfortunately one of the most revealing and rather insulting choice by the filmmaker one that seven a film a lot like this one knew not to make wa to put the name of the killer in the opening credit that may give the actor credit for the role but throughout the film hidden in my mind i wa waiting for him to appear on screen which spoiled the mystery however credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film plotwise kiss the girl show almost no originality we are introduced to detective alex cross morgan freeman a forensic psychologist and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him a the hero he get a call about a woman who ha shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene at his house cross is told that his neice naomi gina ravera ha been missing for four day this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two and a a result we can t sympathize with detective cross however what make kiss the girl slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees before she is abducted dr kate mctiernan ashley judd the actress of the judd family is a smart athletic woman and because of these trait becomes a target for casanova what the serial killer like to call himself because of these character developing scene we care for mctiernan making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful after being abducted mctiernan wake up and find herself in a cell somewhere in the wood remembering that the killer gave her certain rule she decides to break one of them by calling out when casanova come to punish her she break out and escape by jumping over a waterfall after she is found she begin to help cross find his neice from this moment on kiss the girl take on the form of every other serial killer film a the two lead search for the rest of the victim held captive many people will compare this film to s seven another killer film starring morgan freeman but i presume that the similarity are intentional the screenplay by david klass is adapted from the novel written by james patterson and yet i don t quite see how this story could have worked in novel form what make kiss the girl so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness the cinematography by aaron schneider is reminiscient of seven and sometimes i felt that many of the shot were trying too hard to impress u sometimes a simple shot is the best one however many of the shot are stunning and unlike seven most of them take place during the day in sunlight the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done in more than one way the camera work is terrific but the editing make this scene work so well the chaotic and mtv type cutting give the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness exactly what judd s character is experiencing however the best aspect of kiss the girl is it actor morgan freeman is one of today s most powerful and believable actor detective cross is a very good character for him although it is just a similar one to the character in seven because of freeman s powerful presence he carry half the film by himself the other half is carried by ashley judd one of today s most promising dramatic actress in fact her performance is better than freeman s if that is even possible her character is more original than freeman s and she handle it wonderfully we finally have a female character in a movie like this who doe more than just scream the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped but the cast member do a much a they can with it cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina and unfortunately ha scrap for a character tony goldwyn fair slightly better but we don t really get to know his character either gina ravera give a good performance but again she isn t in many of the scene so a a result of all these small supporting part the weight of the film lie on the two lead and they do a phenomenal job some of the best acting of this genre and some of the best acting of the year two other essential aspect of the film are quite good director gary fleder doe a good job of controlling his actor but the second half of the film loses believability especially during the revelation of the killer he also doesn t handle the suspenseful scene a a better director would have losing a lot of tension during many scene however to his credit he doe manage a terrific first half part of the blame fall on david klass i m sure the book developed many of the lesser character more but klass focus on the two main part while this may give the two lead more screentime many of the small character are one dimensional and the killer when revealed is extremely implausible thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel kiss the girl always seems intelligent none of the conversation are laughable and all move the plot forward without seeming forced one of the biggest problem i had with the movie wa the motive of the killer i blame this mainly on the casting director because the killer s motive is because of rejection from woman or so i assume from the opening monologue but the killer himself is very attractive one of my friend is a shall we say big admirer of the killer kiss the girl is rated r for terror violence language and suggested sex with all the implausibility of this film and with the mediocre second half kiss the girl somehow manages to thoroughly entertain in fact i had the urge to see it again just for the performance the cinematography add a lot of mood to the already creepy tone and the script is usually smart this is clearly one of those movie which rely on the acting to pull it through morgan freeman is possibly today s most convincing actor and ashley judd add another notch on her acting belt i must also say that i loved the ending the showdown between good and evil wa quite tense and the resolution of the scene make almost anyone cheer perhaps it may not be possible but most of the film isn t anyway\n",

activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent or where woman would install webcam in their apartment in order to convert voyeurism into cash this is the world of today and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high concept project like the truman show truman burbank jim carrey seems to have the perfect life he ha a pretty doting wife meryl laura linney a comfortable insurance sale position an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven a reliable childhood buddy marlon noah emmerich except for the dog that paw a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia this is paradise or so it would seem bizarre inexplicable incident begin to crop up in truman s life a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummet from the sky a rainstorm which give new meaning to the term isolated follows him around a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move for the first time in his life it is beginning to dawn on truman that thing are not what they appear to be the truman show directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol is a remarkably well constructed film paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next balancing drama with humour thoughtfulness with abandon this is a film which address an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy in many way mr niccol s screenplay mirror the spirit of his previous gattaca both film focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity with pivotal character defining moment occurring at sea although the film s rather conventional climax doesn t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two third and ultimately just fall short on delivering the intended emotional punch there are moment through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving a truman attempt to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implication behind his discovery of deception despite the multitude of pertinent issue being broached by the film it remains foremost a finely crafted piece of entertainment constantly light and accessible the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude and a the carefully stacked seahaven house of card tumble down the film eschews any psychological ramification for a man discovering that the fundamental of his entire existence have been false the end act of the truman show essentially boil down to a rehash of the reliable crowdpleasing underdog v the system formula while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept some element are lacking the device of mysterious lauren sylvia natascha mcelhone a a contributing impetus to truman s growing awareness isn t exactly convincing there s not much of a discernable spark between either the two character or the actor themselves and the scene in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ed harris with regard to the moral ambiguity of his action unnecessarily spell thing out for the audience thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film in fact although the film smartly restricts the number of scene depicting the real world outside truman s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shot from enraptured gazers it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even more deeply in the insulatory seahaven world with the resultant effect that the repercussion felt a the film finally shift outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling still the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target and it insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti voyeuristic tirade such a that of the recent costa gavras film mad city i ve always believed that the versatile m linney possesses a tremendous comic gift she ha always seems to have a impish gleam in her eye and in the truman show she run rampant with her duplicitous character mischievously flashing a glazed insanely jovial grin a she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogan cheerfully going over the top it s hilarious to watch her who would have ever guessed that she d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laugh department of a film m linney is a delight in the film but it is mr carrey who rule the show here he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interlude which typify his traditional part but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal it s difficult not to root for truman in a commanding performance mr carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which make him a genuinely engaging presence and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn demonstrating admirable restraint there s an early scene where he s down on his knee gardening and given his past track record one almost instinctively anticipates mr carrey to pull one of more infamous and in this case wholly inappropriate sight gag it s almost poetic how this notorious look at me actor successfully tone it down to play a character who s constantly the centre of attention in addition to the fine performance by the bulk of the cast mr emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman s antiseptic white picket fenced smalltown utopia and by burkhard dallwitz s original score technical credit are first rate all around while the truman show is clearly a definitive high concept film it s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one obvious predecessor utilising common element abound ranging from s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british tv series the prisoner all the same this is a visionary award calibre film entertaining provocative and intelligent the curious and possibly disturbing thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film s concept seems unfathomably outrageous it s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching if not actualisation at least permissiveness of such a scenario perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world\n",

holding back to prevent offending audience the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewer but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film say about narrow mindedness chocolat center it story around the small french village of lansquenet where majority rule and the majority life by only one law religion the bulk of the townspeople with few exception are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence lent but when the independent thinking seemingly non religious vianne rocher juliette binoche and her daughter anouk victoire thivisol make the village their home the people will be tempted beyond belief by

mentally retarded warren w earl brown who s being harassed by one of the school jock it seems warren s sister is the campus queen mary jensen cameron diaz who is impressed with ted s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother despite a very real chance of getting beaten up mary take an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom ted wa just flattered that she even knew his name unfortunately prom night is ruined when ted ha an accident with his zipper at which every man in the theater will wince and is sent to the hospital fast forward to the present where ted ha cleaned himself up now writes for a magazine but ha weekly therapy session in order to deal with his obsession of the past year mary whom he hasn t seen since that fateful day with the help of his friend dom chris elliott ted hire slimy private investigator pat healy matt dillon to track down his only love however when pat find mary he fall for her too and soon the both of them are competing for her affection there s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly who brought u dumb and dumber and kingpin not exactly intelligent comedy they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friend or co worker to think you had such a great time watching them with their current film the farrelly brother have come up with something you ll not only enjoy but also won t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic style from the subtle to the ridiculous and while a few of the gag might be offensive to some seeming like residual from the farrelly brother last two film they almost all work i have not seen many movie in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on one minute you ll be laughing at something ted say and the next you ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary s apartment one of the great thing this film ha going for it is ben stiller he is perfectly cast in the role of ted because he s a guy who just look awkward in almost every situation ted s a nice fellow and try to do his best but for some reason or another thing just don t always work out it s comical but also ha that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top actually i ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid eighty the film wa like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise paul newman film the color of money entitled the hustler of money in it stiller played wince not vince who is taken under the wing of an older man played by john mahoney to become a big time bowling hustler it wa parody at it finest more of which showed up in the short lived the ben stiller show on the fox network in late early like the critic which aired on abc then fox i still mourn that show s cancellation cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she date and some of the quality she look for make mary look paper thin at time however diaz pull the role off with such panache and charm that you can still see why she s got guy just falling over each other to be with her heck i even found her laugh to be cute even though i thought it wa annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn t change and you know it s really true he and ralph macchio must hang out or something maybe they live in dick clark s pool house anyway here s another good piece of casting a dillon slip beautifully into the role of the guy who try to worm his way into mary s heart the supporting performance are also good chris elliott ha a bigger part than in the abyss yes check it out next time and less annoying than in cabin boy lin shae who play mary s neighbor magda and also appeared a the landlady in kingpin provides some good laugh especially in scene with her benji like dog which act a the focal point for a few of the funniest moment of the film lee evans a mary s friend tucker display a flexibility in acting and accent which surprise and contributes to an interesting plot twist the farrelly brother and scriptwriter ed decter and john j strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren t any noticeable time where the film drag the only problem i saw wa their use of a couple of musician who provide segue between several key scene they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot relevant information right toward the camera it s a device which wa amusing for about three second when they opened the film after that it got a little annoying and it s unfortunate that those spot interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow fortunately filled with sight gag humorous line and solid comedic acting there s something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater\n",

      "Sentence: plot a young recruit get plucked out of nowhere by the number one gangster in london and quickly becomes a staple by his side but this new guy is not like all the others he s got ambition he s got goal and he love everything he see about being the number one gangster violence lot of swearing and betrayal ensue critique a very good serious minded unique british gangster flick which miss the great mark by way of an annoying voice over popping up throughout the film and a so so ending here s yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix okay so it s not entirely new but it s definitely original when all put together a done here the thing i liked most about this movie wa it authentic portrayal of the time period in which it wa taking place it s and these dude are looking good yes it s all about the suit fella the italian shoe the cufflink the tie and the bird that s lady for those uninitiated hanging around you here are a bunch of horrible men gangster if you will looking sharp talking shit and busting head all over the place but that s not the basis of this movie the basis of this film come in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group the excellent david thewlis and one of his crony paul bettany also extremely good in this film and how the power sex appeal and coolness of one affect the other you know how there are always these hanger on gangster type who latch on to the godfather the leader the top dog of every crime organization well most of the time these dude are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person that is their bos so all the gangster number one need to worry about is his enemy on the other side of the fence but this film brings the betrayal the messed up loyalty the honor code among bad guy into play within the same group and present it in quite the stylistic package of course director paul mcguigan isn t trying to be guy ritchie here and doesn t over stylize his presentation jazz it all up with a hip soundtrack or add any humor to the mix nope he go straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scene which are still embedded in my mind a i type this the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he s attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty look into my eye in fact the last time that i ve seen a guy so scared in a movie wa john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brother miller s crossing scary shite but there s an ever better scene than that in this film this one feature bettany once again slowly torturing hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster from that man s point of view but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes one by one that s right he doe the guy in his underwear that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertone present throughout this film especially in the relationship between bettany and his bos why doe he get so upset when he fall in love with that woman but the flick s not perfect in fact i didn t mind malcolm mcdowell s voice over narration at first but a the film grew into a major flashback most of the film is presented a such he came in every now and then and rarely added anything of interest to the plot all he seemed to do wa swear and call people the c word umpteen time and even described one scene a it wa happening so i opened the door then went up the lift etc it s like yeah i know that already i could see it on the screen overdone i also didn t quite buy the ending of the movie which despite being original seemed a little unbelievable especially when you consider that it s supposed to be taking place year later and folk still seem to be holding grudge still in love still living in the same apartment i mean c mon it s year man i don t know somehow it didn t work all that well for me but one of my favorite genre ha always been the crime movie and this one is a decent addition to the lot forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell s narration of the obvious plot point and concentrate on the film s stronger attribute such a it style the exquisite atmosphere of the time period it original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group it memorable sequence and the solid performance from it two main lead bettany and thewlis incidentally unlike a few of the gangster flick that i mention below this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of film it s the real deal note this film is packed with strong accent all around which make it hard to make out some of the word from time to time it s also quite violent and i don t remember any film that used the c word a much a this one so leave the kid at home for this one where s joblo coming from american psycho a clockwork orange donnie brasco fight club get carter godfather godfather ii goodfellas lock

      "Sentence: seen july at the crossgates cinema albany ny theater at p m with my mom using hoyts cinema cash theater rating very good sound picture and seat it s very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic vivid sense of reality and life all story are about select moment of time and place in the character life but only the truly great one are able to define their reality well enough so the audience can experience it just a the character do therefore gone with the wind deserves accolade for it ability to tell the epic story it doe in such a crafted intricate and entertaining manner it s a crowning achievement not only in filmmaking but for storytelling itself the film take place in georgia before during and after the civil war this play a major factor in the film s success to use such a historic setting present many possibility and problem since no one wa alive at the time to verify it accuracy it might also seem cliche boring and other such deterent factor to potential viewer can a story set so long ago be relatable now the film confronts all these problem paradoxically by not cronfronting them it doesn t simply plug in the right thing at the right time it creates an entire reality where everything make sense and said concern are irrelevant building a strong foundation is important to all form of medium without which what is there to build on we re given some backstory here and learn a little about our character especially our main character scarlett o hara leigh a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel a cunning wit and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time she know how her society work wherein everything she doe can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequence may be being the most sought after woman allows her to manipulate men and their woman to ensure she get her way whether it be obvious i e who will be the one to get her food or subtle i e getting married just to spite someone the man she claim to love is ashley wilkes howard a modest gentleman who doe not seem to have the same passion for her a she doe for him he isn t so arrogant and demanding a scarlett in fact he s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his her name is melanie de havilland and she is one of the sweetest kindest and most likable character one will ever see she and scarlett become very dear friend but she never suspect the jealously scarlett ha for her and the love she ha for her husband her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic it defines who she is but doesn t give her much emotional self defense acting a catalyst to the love triangle and to the story a a whole is the daper stong willed cunning cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler gable he s quite a character all right everyone listens to what he ha to say even though he s got a bad reputation butler make no apology for his vast amount of money nor his behavior he tell everyone the much needed truth in the rigid caste like society where freewill doesn t seem to exist everything is done out of honor and tradition for example in his first appearance butler tell his fellow southerner there s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out this anger them not for his lack of faith but because he ha the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that do we have ammunition factory do we have food do we have a navy all we have is tobacco all true statement and yet the south still insists he s wrong butler is a shifty character to be sure but he take such pride in his arrogance it s appealing scarlett notice this too when she first see him and from the look butler give her we know he s not going to stop until he ha her but scarlett can t get past her need for ashley and during a scene which set the stage for the grand story butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever and so the story go on with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life the conflict she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband especially after she is marked for life when her first husband dy this give the film many opportunity to bring in more character into the epic story some are vital for only a few scene but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film in most film only a few character exist for support in background but this film is more realistic and believable a it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone ha signficance even people in the background seem more than just extra wandering the set the costuming design is outstanding so that the film make for a real sense of time and place the filmmaker could have easily set more scene indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside real world but these type of simple approach are never taken the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last day of the civil war fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is one scene ha scarlett working a a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming no not my leg don t cut off my leg another scene show her simplying trying to cross a street but a the camera pull back we see that her path is blocked by hundred of wounded soldier but it is their moaning that s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be a the second half begin the film concentrate more on scarlett a a completely independent woman who single handedly take care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north she manages to resurrect the family plantation but all the willpower she ha can t help her when she must pay exuberhant tax set by the north after the south s ultimate defeat this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begin their torrid love hate relationship most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship or lack thereof between rhett and scarlett each us the other for personal gain but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other scarlett continues to use her manipulative power over men to get what she want and because rhett can t help but want her more every time she try to one up him such a marrying another man and taking over his business they say opposite attract but the conflict between rhett and scarlett go way beyond opposing personality it border on magnetic polarization they need each other and know this yet they never seem truly happy together perhaps they mistake love for passion and the film leaf it up to u to make this call both have thing the other want and vice versa but when they compromise is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other love and the perception of love are two completely separate thing and throughout the final act of the film we re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why gable and leigh do have great chemistry always leaving the viewer wondering which emotion were authentic and which were manufacture all none either way is possible and it s a mystery that can not be solved even upon repeated viewing it s safe to say most of u won t live such overly dramatic life a those in gone with the wind but it s still a masterpiece for it ability to give u a sense that we ve just experienced a life s worth of joy and pain\n",

roy hobbs the baseball player who wa destined to be the best there ever wa but still acted like a humble farm boy in butch cassidy and the sundance kid he wa the most dangerous shot in the west yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good looking charmer even in indecent proposal where he played a man who wa so good at making money that he believed he could buy love redford wa still able to exude an aura of shy decency especially when reciting a tale of lost love in his latest film the horse whisperer based on the best selling novel by nicholas evans redford again play such a character redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie i suppose the character of tom booker a man who ha the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horse wa just too good to pas up despite his enormous and rare gift when it come to training troubled horse a magazine article coin the phrase horse whisperer to describe his uncanny talent booker see himself a an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life booker s talent are taxed into service by annie maclean kristin scott thomas a new york magazine editor whose daughter grace scarlett johansson wa recently in a horrible accident the accident which is filmed with gut wrenching horror happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horse an eighteen wheeler kill grace s friend severely wound and traumatizes grace s horse pilgrim and cause grace to lose part of her right leg annie belief that if pilgrim can be healed grace will be healed a well which lead her to booker at first she try to get booker to come to new york to see the horse but that doesn t work instead she pack up grace and pilgrim leaf her husband robert sam neill behind and head for the rolling hill of montana where booker run a ranch with his brother frank chris cooper and his sister in law diane dianne wiest in many way the film is like a journey both literally and symbolically the move out west ha always been a great american tradition of renewal and it s hard not to see annie and grace s leaving manhattan for montana a a variation on the classic theme of city v country in the horse whisperer country is clearly the victor the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness and it is not until the character arrive in the wide open space of montana that grace s anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begin to dissipate annie s controlling nature begin to relax and pilgrim once again learns to trust people redford is just a in love with the grand montana country in this film a he wa when he directed a river run through it six year ago in many way the horse whisperer come from the same poetic vein a river and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minute shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera time on the grass and mountain but then that would ruin the magic much of the film s photography is truly elegant and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land to further emphasize this redford and cinematographer robert natural born killer platoon cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film which take place in new york with mostly cold harsh bluish filter and a more squarish aspect ratio when the action shift to montana richardson switch to soft focus and natural lighting and the screen widens to a aspect ratio in term of the story itself the horse whisperer give u the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean s a brief encounter and clint eastwood s adaptation of robert james waller s the bridge of county richard lagravenese co screenwriter here also adapted bridge although the horse whisperer ha a strong romantic sensibility i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who s being left behind for this brief heart sweeping affair but there rarely is in the horse whisperer the thankless role of being the fuddy duddy husband fall to sam neill he play the character a a decent hard working man who is a good husband and father his only failure is that he love his wife more than she love him he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away but simply because he happens to be a normal fairly uninspiring man there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feel about each character it show booker and robert going into a horse pen booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all while robert look somewhat frumpy and out of place in a baseball cap a they enter the pen booker assuredly swing over the fence while robert hesitates then open the gate and in a goofy moment forgets to close it behind him it s a small scene but it clearly demonstrates the movie s thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness after all booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it the best scene in the horse whisperer tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie but rather the healing process of grace and her horse although booker s horse training method are mythical and unrealistic the scene with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing these are paralleled by the scene between him and grace some of which are humorous and all of which are tender and true at some point i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more nevertheless redford is obviously a romantic at heart and he brings a light touch to the erotic moment in the film there are no dramatic sex scene but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow dancing always moving ever closer together that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty body grinding together although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantee unhappiness for just about every character there are enough moment like that which make the horse whisperer worth the price of admission\n",

      "Sentence: in roger michell s romantic comedy notting hill william thacker hugh grant lead a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it s name to the film s title one day american movie superstar anna scott julia robert walk in to purchase a book on turkey quickly enamored of each other the two embark upon an on again off again love affair replete with romance humor and the occasional lump in the throat the film open with a non verbal cue to anna s stardom a the title credit appear over a montage of slow motion sequence featuring the actress s appearance in film and at premiere coming out of limousine walking the red carpet and such without word this sequence give u a background to her character following however is a set up narration by william indicating what he doe and where he life i don t know why the filmmaker chose to go with a narration which tell u nothing we couldn t have figured out by watching the first ten minute of film and which never resurfaces after the movie s beginning but there it is if there were ever a clear case for less is more this would be it the film is told nearly first person from william s point of view a he is in every scene by nature of this arrangement we get a very definite sense of what he is all about and his nice guy personality win u over easily in fact much of notting hill s strength lie in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey soaked apricot from his refrigerator or take an instance where anna kiss william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image william assures her he wouldn t say a word then add well i ll probably tell myself now and then but i d never believe it great stuff the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible we re constantly exposed to william s thought feeling action and desire but don t actually get the sense of how much anna really feel for him there are a couple of instance where she declares her obvious interest but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we re not sure what she s been thinking all the time in between this combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two make this hugh grant s film hand down he get the great scene look for one in which he ha to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna the great line and give an overall wonderful performance julia robert fan will probably be disappointed by the actress s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ala sandra bullock in a time to kill along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character s unpredictable behavior anna doesn t get a lot of our compassion this romantic comedy lean a little more toward the comedy than the romance much of it supplied by grant himself but with considerable help from the supporting cast most notable is rhys ifans a spike william s eccentric roommate who is in the film for no other purpose than to make u laugh hugh bonneville emma chamber james dreyfus and gina mckee bring up the guard a william s friend and family particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister s birthday dinner and we get to see how these common folk react to the presence of a movie star in their midst it s a scene most of u will probably think would play out in our own living room were we faced with a similar situation roger michell s use of visuals doesn t sweep u off our foot but doe give u more than your typical movie of this type for example there are a couple of instance in this film where large amount of time pas whereas some film are content to simply put in a caption saying eight month later michell present u with more interesting cue such a william s walk though his neighborhood while the season change around him another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred foot in the air we re generally used to scene where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so but in this case the camera just keep going up and up until we have a bird s eye view of the ground below music is used rather glaringly a an enhancement to many of the film s scene and some of this might have been better toned down but in other area it work to full effect it s kind of a mixed bag but still fare better than many of today s lighthearted movie which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video at least this film ha some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate notting hill s grant and robert will not go down in history a one of the all time greatest film pairing but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspect of the movie more than make up for it for a couple of hour you should expect to laugh more than cry and that s not so bad now is it\n",

hallucination whale who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror picture decided fifteen year before his death at age to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him a the film tell it during the end of his life whale at his large home in l a became infatuated with the tall handsome and much younger man clayton boone brendan fraser who wa working a the gardener at his home james whale we learn quickly wa what many people refer to him a in the film a dirty old man in one of the opening scene a young film enthusiast visit whale s home to interview him and whale agrees on one condition for every question he answer the young man must take off an article of clothing because of this episode we know exactly what it is whale want when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting later making the excuse that his bright white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off clayon agrees and doesn t really think much of this much to the warning of his friend becoming more and more intrigued in the story whale tell him about his past certainly the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall since whale start to grow a deep love for this young man even though boone is not gay and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life a he begin to seldom suffer mild stroke and moment of true catharsis god and monster is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who wa forced to become somewhat of an outcast due to his sexual preference and never got the recognition he would have liked since he longed to be referred to a a motion picture director rather than a horror director and in one heartbreaking scene he attends a party with boone being his guest held by director george cuckor and find that many of the other attendee do not recognize him anymore it is evident that whale s first love in his life wa making movie and when his career ultimately fell apart so did his passion in life a played brilliantly by ian mckellen james whale come off a a sad but dignified man and a person who wa not afraid to stand out from others just a long a he knew he wa being true to himself he never hid the fact that he wa gay however even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession and it wa this unblinking honesty that made him a great person through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone boone of course only thing of whale a a possible friend or someone he can talk to while it mean so much more to whale who see boone a sort of his salvation in life although boone is only in a dead end job a a gardener of people s home whale view him a the ideal man not only one that is good looking even though it is this attraction that first begin his feeling but one that will actually listen to him since whale life with only his loyal but disapproving maid touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor although an extremely fine and mature picture a few small element hold the film back from ultimate greatness it is appreciated that the film doe not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story development but it is a little thin and the structuring of the on again off again friendship at the film s center is fairly predictable we know early on where these two character are headed and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two a the tension slowly build in lesser hand this set up might have felt too calculated but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that help the film to be much more than this also a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar effectively played by lolita davidovich but abruptly dropped and never brought up again if the film wa not going to follow up on this side story then it perhaps should have been taken out altogether god and monster is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture impressively directed by bill condon who i sense relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone the film also play a a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end walking away from god and monster it wa ian mckellen s marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably it is a sad testament when a person s true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life which ironically enough is no one else s business in the first place\n",

      "Sentence: i actually am a fan of the original or so live action disney flick of the same name starring hayley mill twice a a pair of twin separated at birth by divorcing parent never to come in contact with the other so the parent never have to meet again and everyone should know how i feel about remake especially of film i happen to enjoy my fallacy unless you re going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both just wrack your brain and come up with a gasp new idea this remake wa not originally on the top of my viewing list and wa actually quite the opposite contemporary live action disney film are not one of my favorties anyway they re usually unfunny alienating and a big fat bore at least to anyone over the age of and above the iq of this one however is shockingly not bad in fact it s actually good not the original good but what s great about it is that it doesn t necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit a it doe become entertaining for the same exact reason the original wa entertaining because it s cute and innocent fun because it ha a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with because the lead star is immensely appealing because the parent are also immensely appealing and i m repeating myself because it s cute and innocent fun there s nothing too risque about it save the plot the idea of separating twin and denying them the truth for year is ominously selfish but that is precisely the point of the movie and it s aimed directly at either kid adult who want to remember the original or young adult who want to remember what it wa like to be a kid i personally am somewhere between the second and third i can vividly remember when my taste in movie wasn t so weird or diverse the name godard and kubrick weren t even a glimmer in my right eye back then when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple year to see abc s wonderful world of disney where they d show you a live action and or made for tv disney flick an hour per week i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friend and their mother to see all the rereleased disney film like lady and the tramp and pinnochio and most sadly i remember every single christmas without fail there were a barage of child s animated half hour show made exclusively for the christmas season that i wouldn t dare missing i can even remember seeing the made for tv parent trap ii on tv one night and after i had seen that one over and over and over again i saw the original parent trap it s more of a late childhood movie because it deal with the issue of divorce but it deal with it in a disney ized version it s playful and witty and charming and if i saw it for the first time right now having never experienced that part of my childhood i d probably dismiss it i d probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn t seen the original at such a perfect age watching it i could remember what fun it wa to watch a disney film and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibility of my seemingly perfect parent splitting up and how it affected my adolescence and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke and pointed out that even in the most fucked up of situation thing could always work out if you well manipulate thing a bit at least for the better this new version did that for me but it s also charming in it own way it ha a new cast a contemporary feel and for the first time in awhile for a live action disney flick a tone that isn t corny or condescending but just right the moment that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way and for the first time since the original film the kid actually know better than the foolish adult the story is basically classic by now repeated almost a many time a kurosawa s the seven samurai a pair of twin played here by lindsay lohan just like they were played by hayley mill in the original are separated at birth by their divorcing parent one annie is sent to live with the mother natasha richardson resembling her mother vanessa redgrave more than i had ever noticed in london where she life with her parent and her devoted foppish butler simon kunz a she work a a swingin fashion designer she grows up refined and classy but also with a keen knowledge in sport and poker playing the other hallie is sent to northern california with her father dennis quaid to live on a vineyard with their pseudo maid lisa ann walter and grows up rugged yet charming they both meet at the same camp one that annie want to go to to become more rugged they feud because they look all too similar and are thus in tight competition which result in some nasty prank which wind them in seclusion together in a private out of the way cabin there they become friend then learn about eachother once they know everything they concoct a scheme to switch place so the one can meet the other parent whom they ve only heard of they learn about eachother s life in detail they make sure they look alike which requires hair cutting and notoriously ear piercing a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in pulp fiction and when the end of summer come they switch and hope for the best lindsay lohan doesn t necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mill in the original but she come off just a appealing a she did once she doe though add a couple new thing she make the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original respectively she also add on an american and british accent to each one with one faking the other accent throughout and if you really take notice you can see that the fake one accent aren t exactly perfect she s also incredibly appealing not merely cute which is especially notable since this is her first feature film and we know how notorious child actor are especially in their first film she make a great protagonist and it only help that the supporting cast is equally appealing dennis quaid in fact hasn t been this likable in about a decade his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what ha made him a notable actor in the past not just that he s mr meg ryan ditto natasha richardson except that she just hasn t ever been this likable period the two make a winning couple maybe not so winning a maureen o hara and the late brian keith in the original but they still work for this film instead of the bickering that ensued in the original the film add another dimension and another angle to their character that wa amiss in the original during the opening credit we see glimpse from their courtship on the qe where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother and when back together again the film s more smarmy scene come off a actually sentimental but in that great way not the migraine inducing way a in many such film this all brings this new parent trap to a level of entertainment that hasn t really existed since well the original film year ago still my money the best live action disney flick of all time this is because it ha a form of intelligence and wit that make such plot point a an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot a gold digging sharon stone type played by elaine hendrix who s deliciously tormented by the twin later on in the film a treat instead of a bore like the original this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be case in point it take two starring the olsen twin because it treat the child a the smart one and the adult a the silly one not the other way around and because above everything it know exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew however in comparison with the original it could be a bit better certain scene work well but not nearly a well a they worked in the original i liked the way the parent fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flame getting back together over a bottle of wine somehow feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing a lesson extracted from the howard hawk cary grant film of yesteryear and a much a this film transcends mere cutedom compared to the original this film almost drowns in cutedom the original though not gritty wa far more stylized and just a suitable for adult audience a it wa for young audience a such this remake may never be nearly a great or classic a the original film but it at least know how to treat it source material with dignity and respect and how to create virtually the same effect without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyance\n",

after the sixth sense which is still going strong at the box office these two film are undoubtedly going to be compared judging from practically all of my fellow audience member last night and although they have eerily similar storyline stir of echo is more of a straightforward psychological horror film while the sixth sense is closer to a psychological drama additionally while the sixth sense had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly ha been one of the major factor in it recent repeat business stir of echo is more conventional and predictable in it final twist and where the sixth sense wa disturbing stir of echo is just plain scary i have a feeling most viewer are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarity and will foolishly forget to judge this film on it own respectable merit adapted from a novel by richard matheson that wa written some forty year ago stir of echo open with a cute six year old boy named jake zachary david cope who is taking a bath he is speaking directly at the screen but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there finally he asks doe it hurt to be dead apparently jake see the ghost of dead people but unlike the sixth sense this young child isn t the focus of the picture instead tom witzy kevin bacon a chicago lineman is our protagonist jake is his son and maggie kathryn erbe whom ha just discovered she is six week pregnant is his hard working wife one night while at a party with their closest friend tom convinces maggie s new age sister lisa illena douglas to try and hypnotize him it unexpectedly work and before long tom is seeing thing he wouldn t normally see including a deceased teenage girl jenny morrison in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six month seeking help from lisa she tell him that while he wa under hypnosis she told him that after he awoke his mind will remain clear and free like an opened door she didn t expect it to work but it did and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he see stir of echo isn t a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination but in the thick atmospheric mood it conjures up it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror drama and is not only effective on a technical level but is impressive in it portrayal of a struggling working class family kevin bacon and especially kathryn erbe s dream with the fish are top notch and exceedingly believable a a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problem after tom is hypnotized and start seeing ghastly vision he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he ha seen lurking in his house and instead of maggie not being understanding she instead belief what tom say and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through doe not try to stop his pursuit bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood star like tom cruise and julia robert and therefore are easier to relate to and always plausible a a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their job just to make end meet in a masterfully done entrancing sequence tom is hypnotized by lisa but instead of watching him we instead see what he see starting from his view a he close his eye into darkness lisa tell him to visualize being in an empty movie theater and so we a audience member are watching a movie screen from inside a theater which is also showing a movie screen in a theater telling him to move closer and closer to the screen a a fuzzy word in black letter pop up on the screen we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is sleep never before have i seen a hypnotism scene a mesmerizing and brilliantly construed a this one truthfully this set piece and another in which tom wake up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he ha just dreamt are worth the full price of admission alone just to see them on the big screen having load of fun with her small role a maggie s sister lisa illeana douglas s to die for her last great character is a delight but rarely used to her full advantage in feature film funny and enjoyably offbeat douglas get to utter the best line in the film while talking to maggie about tom s vision of the girl she remark i wouldn t be worried about him seeing another girl although the fact that she s dead give one pause also of note are jenny morrison s intersection who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character and liza weil remarkable in s whatever a morrison s grieving teenage sister debbie if the resolution of stir of echo doe not live up to it obviously frightful full potential and it doesn t what come before is both involving and appropriately gritty the music score by james newton howard and unsettling use of whisper and ghostly sound effect successfully compliment and foreshadow the off kilter frame of mind that tom is put into and director david koepp prof once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situation that revolve around realistically written character stir of echo isn t a good a the sixth sense but why should it need to be both film are fully capable of standing on their own two foot and stir of echo really is a spinetinglingly good horror film\n",

      "Sentence: i swear i have seen the edge before in fact it reminded me of the bear the river wild and other various film mixed into an entirely different film however the edge ha done something that most action film should do and that is add heart and character we like to the plot in doing so the edge draw many more suspenseful moment out of cliched scene than say the peacemaker unfortunately because of those overused moment we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprise to mess with your head one surprise in particular left me smiling just because mamet actually had the gut to add it to his script action film are a dime a dozen in hollywood and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining u they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre intelligence even horror film have learned this a genre which is probably the least respected of them all the river wild wa one of the best action suspense film i have seen from the s the intelligence of the screenplay and the suspense drawn from the realistic character is nearly unmatched to this day the edge ha the intelligence and smart character but this time the lack of originality is the downfall i must admit that it wa very suspenseful and had an original third half but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliche and plot hole this is an example of the final act saving the film instead of the other way around a in the lost world if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minute intensity it could have become a great action film and i use the term loosely the edge is pretty much a survival of the fittest film but taking scream s lead the edge make fun of the genre s cliche and then us them though not quite a effectively charles morse anthony hopkins is the main character a rich and very intelligent man who wonder what the accumulation of all this knowledge ha brought to him for once we don t immediately care for the main character instead we like bob alec baldwin a photographer who is going to take picture of charles wife mickey elle macpherson out in the wilderness they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic charles birthday is the same day and he receives a gold watch from his wife and a pocket knife from bob a action film go these item do have importance to the rest of the story but quite a bit more than we first expect soon however bob want to find a native to shoot picture of because of his personality charles bob bob s assistant steve harold perrineau and the pilot head off to find him and a shown in the preview hit a flock of bird flying south for the winter down the plane go the pilot is killed and the three are left to survive in the wilderness director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow and therefore ha to create original way to approach the situation he succeeds often enough for u to enjoy the film take for instance the entire man hunting bear plot this ha been done many time in film with different animal and even bear but given the charles intelligence and bob s uncertainty many of the cliche are given fresh twist even charles himself seems to have seen these action film before my favorite line of the film come from charles most people die in the wilderness because they didn t do the one thing that could save their life thinking despite the predictability of the main plot a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise and made me smile when i realized that everything isn t a it seems anymore i have to write cautiously a to not reveal this surprise so instead i will avoid it entirely the first two third of the edge have many humorous moment to push it along and some of charles survival technique seem possible even making fire from ice tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear but whenever the bear is present the character lose all sensibility i have always wondered why character in film walk over a log to get across water why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across i guess getting chased by a bear make your thought process turn off for a while thankfully we already have begun to care for the character and so we let this small detail slide but some of the technical detail are awkward such a the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make where did they get thread and needle the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature and border on phenomenal anthony hopkins give a terrific performance creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day hopkins usually brings greatness to his role but here he exceeds at gaining the audience sympathy something he definitely did not do in silence of the lamb alec baldwin give one of his best performance i have ever seen it sure is better from his fair game baldwin can be a good or a bad character and here he succeeds at both in a way you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end and baldwin is able to handle the double natured photographer elle give a good performance albeit slight she isn t in the film all that much but for the scene she doe have she handle a an actress not a a model harold perrineau is a good actor and his scene are nice and underplayed he is eliminated early and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable the edge is rated r for graphic violence some gore and language some of the violence is a little too disturbing even for me this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of u are used to but too many cliche bog it down director tamahori ha created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled part david mamet s script though ha a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat and the acting is solid the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn t end with the normal high strung action sequence but with a small detail involving a certain gift it s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear and by the way most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear way to go bart\n",

      "Sentence: there are some work of art that are almost impossible to review not because of their own complexity but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original one of such masterpiece is casablanca probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art but definitely the most popular one it popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remake that were made in more than half a century since it premiere but also in countless tribute and reference that movie maker use in their work to this day casablanca is also a movie that ha the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critic and loved by general audience one of the thing that make this film even more unique wa the fact that it wa doomed to fail at least judging by conventional movie making wisdom of it time it wa based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn t been produced on stage screenplay by three writer julius g epstein philip j epstein and howard koch wa beeing written a shooting went along the main actor were producer second choice and finally man behind camera michael curtiz wa considered to be capable but not great director however the movie wa commercially successful and earned three oscar including the one for the best film until this very day it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film making in it own golden age the plot of the movie wa heavily influenced by the need of ww propaganda yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstance of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story in casablanca exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral yet nazi collaborating french vichy government thousand of refugee from war torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america and ready to pay any price for precious exit visa many shady character thrive on their misery including the corrupt police chief captain renault rain his best friend is rick blaine bogart who used to be idealistic anti fascist and now owns popular night club in casablanca and life by his own cynical philosophy of sticking his neck for nobody however everything change when he get in possession of two precious extra visa this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugee to casablanca one of them is victor laszlo henreid czech resistance leader who escaped three time from nazi concentration camp and became the legend of enslaved europe he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund bergman with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris the couple need visa especially because of the gestapo major strasser veidt being on their trail rick is now forced to choose between love wounded pride self preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration humphrey bogart most legendary actor in the history of cinema is one of the rare character actor who elevated his persona to the star status bogart s portrayal of rick a complicated man torn between idealistic past and bitter present wa so perfect that his icon would forever be connected with that character another icon in his company is ingrid bergman great actress of old hollywood here in her artistic and visual prime the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbol of that era of filmmaking some happier time when the romance on the screen didn t look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary work for many people casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made but the reason for that isn t the romance itself it s the realistic story of people forced to make tough and often wrong choice in their life the casting of casablanca wa right on target not just in a case of main lead the supporting actor also did a marvellous job sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic john huston s maltese falcon yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original character another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid a the weakest part of love triangle character of victor laszlo ha believable charisma and look like a somebody who could inspire million of people to rise against nazi tiranny unfortunately the charisma that burdened laszlo leaf little place for difficult choice making his character forever overshadowed by rick ilsa coupling however rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca captain renault brilliantly portrayed by claude rain in a role of a lifetime wa embodiment of perfect almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie rain managed to make renault sympathetic character and his final conversion to the side of good symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary rain also gave another dimension to the movie making it even more ambiguous people who like to analyse movie to death discovered sign of homosexuality in renault s relationship towards rick and rick s final word leave room for even more outrageous speculation together with well drawn character and exciting story the movie wa good in creating his own atmosphere professional nitpicker would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracy but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww movie that is beliavable if not realistic any way even if we don t see it a a historical document casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment a well a infinite inspiration\n",

      "Sentence: when i initially set out to review this film my tag line wa going to be you too can believe whale can fly then it wa going to be you too can believe pastel triangle can fly then it wa going to be you too can believe wood sprite can fly finally i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say there s a lot of flying going on in this film a our first host steve martin tell u the original concept behind fantasia wa to bring it out every year with some old segment retained and some new segment added in well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while because approximately sixty year have passed since the original classic wa released part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it wa first released in grossing somewhere close to in it original month of release subsequent re release of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it ha finally achieved and rightfully deserved to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before six story high in an exclusive four month engagement from january st to april th fantasia can be seen at many imax theater across the u after the engagement is over the film will be shown at regular theater is the format effective for the film with a few exception yes the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven s fifth symphony it s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangle flitting about happily everything seems to be going great for these little thing until the ground erupts with swarm of evil black bat like triangle that attack and engulf their lighter counterpart eventually shaft of light from above help drive away the evil bat like thing and peace return to the butterfly thing though this segment isn t very story driven some of the image are very visually strong especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat thing who are all outlined in blood red color begin to overtake the sky the next segment is set to ottorino respighi s the pine of rome in this segment some humpback whale swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive iceberg that pepper the oceanscape a whale calf get into a scuffle with some nearby bird during the flight and end up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smash into while trying to avoid the bird attack he is finally saved by another liberating shaft of light and he and his brother take to the sky and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the ocean of cloud again visuals are the key with this segment especially where the whale are involved reportedly the whale a viewed on an imax screen in certain sequence are shown a actual size the cgi whale look incredibly life like except for some googly cartoon eye drawn onto the image one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whale being cast through the wall of an iceberg a the whale calf try to find a way out to it parent absolutely beautiful stuff the third segment and the least of the eight segment is set to george gershwin s rhapsody in blue this segment is designed a a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld and intertwines four different story about sad soul living in depression era new york there s a construction worker who dream of being a jazz drummer an out of work sad sack that dream of having a job a young girl that dream of spending time with her parent instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm and a nebbish who dream of being free from his overbearing wife i won t go into how everything work out but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending unfortunately the story drag quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segment segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich s piano concerto no and is an animated version of han christian andersen s the steadfast tin soldier a one legged toy tin soldier fall in love with a wind up clock ballerina whom he assumes is also one legged because he can t see her other leg extended out behind her much to the dismay of an evil jack in the box jester the jester knock the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina little doe the jester know the soldier ha been deposited in the sewer and ha journeyed through the pipeline only to be swallowed by a fish that ha been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldier that the one legged one come from the soldier eventually save the day and get the girl although the ending ha been altered from the andersen story the steadfast tin soldier is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short some child may find the jester to be a little frightening but otherwise the segment is well made segment five is the funniest of the bunch set to camille saint saens the carnival of the animal this segment feature a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingo with a yo yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligator and hippo dancing in the first fantasia it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original fantasia and it s the one that people remember most the sorcerer s apprentice the story is the most recognizable so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo unfortunately the segment wasn t made to be presented on large format film considering it wa shot full frame and exhibit large amount of grain there were at least two occasion where image were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain similar problem crop up on modern day release when projected on screen too large for the image to be shown accurately but no one seems to notice for some strange reason an anomaly common to many plus screen theater segment seven is set to sir edward elgar s pomp and circumstance march no and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character donald duck star a an assistant to noah whose task is loading all of the animal onto the ark during the loading donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn t make it on the boat they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventure mainly involving donald being crushed by animal in various manner despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece it display more emotion in it final scene than many of the tear jerker foisted on audience these day powerful stuff segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich saving the best for last set to igor stravinsky s the firebird an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape tree bloom and flower blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation when the sprite examines the formation it awakens and becomes the titular firebird in a stunning spectacle the firebird rear back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in it path including everything that the sprite ha worked to create some amazing animation is present here and well worth the ten dollar a ticket alone although brush stroke are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film the host segment are largely no pun intended throwaway although steve martin s clip is pretty funny be sure to stay through the credit for a little more humor from martin penn and teller are usually funny but here their gag seem routine and therefore uninteresting the best segment come from of all people bette midler who get to tell u about some of the abandoned segment that never made it off of the drawing board piece like flight of the bumblebee a take on the four horseman set to wagner s ride of the valkyrie and a strange segment prepared in the s by salvador dali that never wa shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installment for fan of visual stimulation or classical music fantasia is a perfect way to spend the afternoon the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material a i mentioned earlier in the review if ten dollar seems like too much for you to spend on this film fear not because after it run in imax theater it is going to be brought out in regular theater i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though then you too can believe that whale triangle thing sprite can fly g\n",

      "Sentence: star war episode the phantom menace review by matt pusateri few movie evoke nostalgia enthusiasm and affection like george lucas classic star war the original blockbuster film and it two sequel not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers but ha deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture arguably more american today can explain what the force or a jedi is than a budget deficit or a serb so year after the release of the original and year since the third film the return of the jedi how can any new star war film withstand the weight of incomparable expectation and anticipation can a new storyline and a new cast of character possibly compete with the legend of the first trilogy luke han solo and darth vader all cultural icon against this challenge the fourth star war film episode one the phantom menace hit the screen last week and despite some early critical review in the major medium the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series it is nonetheless engaging exciting and visually breathtaking it is a worthy sequel er prequel to the original star war film the phantom menace take place decade before the setting of original film a the film open obi wan kenobi ewan mcgregor the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star war is only a young jedi apprentice still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor qui gon jinni liam neeson the republic government ha sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that ha developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiation but in the middle of a planetary invasion rushing to protect naboo s young queen amidala natalie portman later after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice on tatooine qui gon discovers a young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd who not only can help them get the part they need but display uncanny intelligence insight and instinct qui gon sens the child is unusually strong with the force and begin to suspect that he may be the one prophesized to bring balance to the force a anyone who ha watched the original star war trilogy know far from being a galactic savior the innocent looking year old will in time become the ruthless darth vader complicating matter further is a mysterious hooded figure darth sidious is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo and sends out a lethal apprentice darth maul to find and capture queen amidala while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul if the plot sound a bit complicated it is the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of character and an immediate crisis but set up the foundation for the event that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic the demise of the jedi knight anakin s turn to evil and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy but the complexity is not overwhelming the story move quickly with the only drawback being that many question predictably remain unanswered at the end of the film setting the stage for the next episode one of the reason the film s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing but too unfocused it s unclear whose story phantom menace is in the original trilogy the movie were clearly luke s story with the story centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight but it s unclear whether this new film is anakin s story or obi wan s if this trilogy is centered on anakin it s a shaky foundation lloyd like many child actor lack the subtle acting skill of adult performer and a a result his character seems shallow and unimpressive on screen we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little boy face or for that matter any presence that would make him seem so special that qui gon is willing to believe he is the one the rest of the cast doe fine though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas neeson is perfect a an aging jedi knight mcgregor is well cast a obi wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility portman fit the role of a young queen well but her line were often very formal giving her little room to give her character much personality the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the character but the interaction between them individually the character in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star war and the storyline is not more confusing than previous film in the series but unlike the previous trilogy lucas doesn t do a good of a job playing the character off one another in star war there were immediate contrast and memorable exchange between luke and han han and obi wan and leia and luke the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitude and personality in the sequence in where luke han and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star the audience learns a lot about all four character in the way they react to the immediate problem and each other there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the character and their relationship with each other individually they are interesting character with clear motivation and interest but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film and is probably the reason it ha disappointed many reviewer but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction the film is still very engaging many of the wonderful element of lucas previous film make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining first of course is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates the character visit magical underwater city evade dinosaur sized sea monster fight battle droids and menacing destroyer on venetian looking planet of naboo watch a spectacular event part roman chariot race part nascar circuit on the arid desert planet of tatooine then head to corsucant the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council each location is elaborate and complex lucas never settle for vague idea about the look of his setting he creates rich spectacular landscape palace and skyline most of the new special effect in his re released special edition trilogy in were change that allowed him to give the earlier movie the look and feel that just weren t possible when the film were made more than ever in this new film lucas universe is filled with a menagerie of creature robot with personality and a supporting cast of alien who interact with the main character the best such character is watto a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother a slave watto ha a scratchy italian voice and a short paunchy body with oddly mismatched wing that flutter like a hummingbird a he float around the room of all the computer generated character in the film watto is the best done and most enjoyable speaking of computer generated character no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film jar jar binks with more than minute of screen time jar jar is the realization of george lucas dream to include a fully computer generated character into the cast of the new trilogy jar jar a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race literally stumble his way into the path of the jedi knight early in the film and becomes qui jon s accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs a comic relief role in the film lightening scene with his mishap and inability to stay out of trouble the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless and he interacts with the character throughout the film a if he were really on the set with the actor however despite the technological magic that make his character possible jar jar isn t completely convincing he still move and sound too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene throughout the movie jar jar never transcends a roger rabbit like presence you accept that he s there but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character initially i found jar jar annoying but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film on my second viewing of the film jar jar wa a lot of fun and i didn t mind him at all a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star war movie is that the film is replete with humor and small detail that flesh out the world lucas creates despite all the film s struggle between good and evil and the sober musing about one s destiny and the force like all star war film the phantom menace never take itself too seriously fortunately lucas hasn t lost sight of the fact that his film are entertainment not high art from the bumbling jar jar to a one man two headed announcer team calling the action at the film s thrilling pod race sequence to a cameo appearance by e t in the film the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun with lot of half hidden joke and humor that can easily be missed and finally the phantom menace work because a in all his film there is no shortage of speed and action from beginning to end there are light saber battle hair raising chase and thrilling duel between good and evil the pod race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scene in any star war film and the final showdown between obi wan qui gon and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed most thrilling fight sequence lucas ha filmed the phantom menace won t win any major oscar it probably won t beat titanic s box office record and it s not even the best star war film i d put it third after the original and the empire strike back but it s an exciting and entertaining film far better than your typical summer blockbuster the film can t live up to it s hype no film not even the original star war could have done that but it s still worth seeing probably more than once\n",

this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman s black private dick that s a sex machine to all the chick to the big screen hardly qualifies a groundbreaking filmmaking yet nearly year after it original release and long after the genre it spawned blaxploitation died with that decade the remains an extremely entertaining watch never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness the reason for this is the same one that explains the film s connection with moviegoer far beyond the target african american audience the title character of john shaft while the fact that the strong smart virile and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance his broad based appeal stem from an idea that transcends race he is comfortable confident and proud about who he is and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his as this fact also explains why john singleton s yg revival of john shaft is a enjoyable a it is much like the film that started the franchise this s plot doesn t score point in the originality department but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thriller contrary to what ha been reported over the past few month this is not a remake of the original film but more of a sequel spinoff the star audience know and love from the original film and it first two sequel s and s richard roundtree once again play john shaft who still run a private investigation firm in new york city however the focus of the film lie on his same named nephew samuel l jackson who a the film begin is a cop whose take no crap demeanor constantly leaf him at odds with his superior when a privileged young man named walter wade jr christian bale accused of a brutal racially motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail a disgusted shaft leaf the force and decides to take matter into his own hand a a p i but that s easier said than done for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is people hernandez jeffrey wright a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri toni collette the only eyewitness to his crime people or rather wright is also the big obstacle in jackson s way toward commanding this film people is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time and wright is insanely funny during these stage however he isn t so funny a to make the character come off a goofy and buffoonish and people eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo who bowed out before filming it s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson who is his usual captivating charismatic self here but that s exactly what wright doe and make it seem effortless then again with such a talented ensemble surrounding him it is not too surprising that jackson s impressive star turn doesn t quite tower over the rest he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co star bale ha already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in so it only follows that his performance a a similar less exaggerated character would be spot on collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight a the frightened conflicted diane busta rhyme brings some good laugh a shaft s sidekick rasaan registering not a strongly but through no fault of their own are vanessa williams a tough narcotic cop carmen vasquez and a dismayingly underused roundtree they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price singleton and shane salerno jackson also ha little to do in a sense some throwaway footage during the opening credit aside his shaft doesn t even have one sex scene that singleton once again prof his ability with actor is an especially good thing since he s not really an action director this is not to say that he doe a bad job with the numerous gunfight and the requisite foot and car chase they move well a doe the film a a whole and are reasonably exciting it s just that there s nothing terribly inventive about them these set piece are functional in the way the script is they work well enough but they re unsurprising and conventional but if there s anything that a movie doe well it s make the familiar look cool and this keep that tradition alive from the slick title sequence scored of course to isaac hayes ever infectious oscar winning theme song which singleton wisely sprinkle throughout the film on the film look great and easily sweep the viewer into it world with it energetic bravado even a common visual trick such a employing fancy wipe for scene transition not only feel unforced it feel necessary style doesn t exactly make for a great film but when it come to that s of little consequence what matter above all else is having a good time and the latest should be just the first of many fun ride to be had with this bad mutha shut

together the little mermaid harkened back to and perhaps surpassed the classic disney animation from the first half of the century however the endless stream of the little mermaid wan na be s is getting to me you know the spiel a lame plot recycled from some well known story colorful almost psychedelic animation the lead character who learns a valuable moral lesson the comedic sidekick sidekick the seemingly unattainable love interest a few catchy song a few in joke for adult and the occasional out of place warner brother coyote fall off the cliff type joke it s a formula and like any formula it get tiresome that s why i m delighted to hear that disney recently picked up the international distribution right to the work of ghibli a japanese cartoon studio from what i ve seen of their movie kiki s delivery service and the already english dubbed and american distributed my neighbor totoro foreign audience are in for a treat these movie particularly kiki s delivery service are wonderfully original and entertaining kiki s delivery service start with an unusual premise kiki upon hearing forecast of clear sky decides it is time for her to leave home this is unusual because kiki isn t a college student or a young adult making her start on the world but a thirteen year old girl eager to begin her training a a witch her mother is also a witch and a thirteen is the obligatory age for such training her parent treat her leaving understandingly and put up only token resistance just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audience but no mention is made of the occult and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie kiki s mother act a a village doctor and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom kiki must choose a city to move to and what she chooses is the co star of the movie a german seaport town far removed from the country life she ha been used to initially lost in the impersonal hugeness of her surrounding she s discouraged and unable to support herself though her rudimentary skill a a witch on the verge of leaving for a new town she us her power of flight to deliver a pacifier to a baby who dropped it the favor eventually blossom into her working a a courier a one person delivery service this is where the movie becomes shockingly good kiki s job is a catalyst for her realizing the beauty of the city and the world around her the townspeople she is put in contact possess an inner worth that doesn t seem forced or artificial but merely derived from looking at ordinary people in a different light they re three dimensional impossible to quickly evaluate possessing of fault and understandably reserving in kindness towards a strange girl however each one ha something about them some interest or trait that make them interesting and unique the personal beauty of the citizen is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings the seaport town genuinely look impressive capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern need of the s this beauty is beauty with depth for every detail left in dozen are only hinted at i could probably go on all day but i won t suffice it to say that many of these minor detail could have been the highlight of the movie some of my favorite are kiki s relationship with the baker s husband although he s quiet never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie and he initially scare her his kindness win her friendship in the garage of a deliveree s house can be found a vintage model t two old lady have a relationship evolving from master servant to friend friend such detail give the impression that the beauty shown in the movie is only the tip of the iceberg added on top of this is a lesson on the importance of self worth kiki initially seems to derive much of her self worth from the beauty of her surroundings and the people around her but an encounter with a rude girl crash down her bewonderment making her question the importance of such beauty this cause kiki to lose faith in herself however kiki come to realize not only the beauty of her surroundings but the innate beauty inside her seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don t even want to hint at it the ending of the movie ha a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and ironically the most disney esque moment i ve ever seen if you don t hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention the movie steer free of many of the disney convention there is no violence however cartoonish no song and dance number and kiki s pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick although jiji is given many funny line and scene however i would be surprised if disney doesn t give jiji more joke or at least the voice of some comedian refreshingly enough the moral lesson of the movie is not self contradicted a habit disney movie have gotten into beauty and the beast s beautiful belle for instance learned that beauty wa derived from a person s inside and wa then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing kiki on the other hand learns to separate her wardrobe from her self image and nothing more is made of her early desire for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film another difference with disney movie is in the style of animation for kiki s delivery service not a colorful and dynamic a disney animation can be but with a greater attention to realism and detail it fit the movie to a t this is particularly true with scene of kiki s flight the extreme realism of the bird in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold and help these scene capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i ve ever seen i m not sure when or how this movie will be released in the united state disney tentatively plan a theater release of monoko hime shortly following the summer japanese release and should start releasing the other ghibli film after that i d guess that some will be released on video and some will be theatrically released in peak season with no competing disney release although the wait is unfortunate it s good to know that it s being released at all for kiki s delivery service is definitely a movie worthy of widespread promotion and release watch this movie along with man bite dog and perhaps something by woody allen this is the best movie i ve ever seen\n",

kind that is not very prevalent in movie today inundated a we are with film which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brook film while the dialog will not be a oppressive a in some of the independent talk film which are finding their way into theater the situation in which his character find themselves are one we can often identify with but even if we can t brook ha the talent to make them comfortable and therefore we laugh teenager and jim carrey fan probably won t find an albert brook movie very funny but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will put simply brook comedy is intelligent mother is albert brook latest film and it doe not disappoint brook play john henderson a middle aged science fiction writer just coming off his second divorce he make an attempt at dating but fails miserably he then ha dinner with his brother jeff rob morrow a successful sport agent who seems to live the ideal life jeff ha a good job a loving family and most of all a warm relationship with their mother beatrice debbie reynolds after dinner john witness a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky dory the dialog is in comparison beatrice always hint at a fault in john and his career every time she talk with him and john give it right back to her at the end of one of their conversation where beatrice ha just picked apart john s life she say i love you and john reply with i know you think you do the thing is beatrice is not overt with her criticism but instead give them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit picking and guilt loading it s the kind that go something like yes dear i think you do that wonderfully but it seems a though nothing he doe make her happy there s always the big but john belief that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationship with woman either because of his flawed self esteem caused by his need for validation or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out woman who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner he come to the conclusion that since his problem are rooted in his boyhood home he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kind of feeling come out and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is a great experiment he call it brook own brand of humor really shine in this film especially in the interaction john ha with his mother there s a scene where john ha just arrived at his mother s house and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito and having explained to his mother about the great experiment beatrice asks now explain to me again why you don t want to stay at a hotel she still doesn t get it and it is absolutely hilarious in the same scene we get little glance at the life his mother lead when she try to feed him food that is no longer fresh she apparently buy in great quantity and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over when john point out the ice on the sherbet beatrice tell him not to worry about the protective glaze you ve named the ice asks john he s also surprised at the variety of item beatrice keep in the refrigerator such a a twenty pound block of cheese the freezer wa a good invention say john but it s not supposed to be used for everything that s why it s smaller than the refrigerator it s something most of u find strangely familiar brook is also a master at employing the non sequitur for example in defending your life his and meryl streep s character are in a comedy club having a discussion when they re finished and walk out brook cut to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line and so the moral is if you have to fart go outside you don t know what the joke wa because you couldn t hear him during the entire scene but i must have laughed for the next five minute it seemed so out of context in this film brook us the same trick a couple of time to open or close a scene i don t want to give them away but suffice it to say they work just a well a they have in the past john s purpose for staying with his mother is to learn and we a the audience learn right along with him his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with but a john spends more time with her we learn thing about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit a enjoyable a the humor that accompanies it each step of the way on screen brook doe an excellent job playing this kind of character you get the feeling he often belief he is the only sane person in an insane world in a way he s very much like yosarian of catch expect with something of an attitude casting debbie reynolds a beatrice is perfect she assumes the part with ease even moving and speaking a little slowly and is just so adorable it s hard to get mad at her character this only help the audience to share the frustration john feel when dealing with her a his first choice brook originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband who wa beginning to show symptom of alzheimer s disease that may be just a well since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely rob morrow also doe a good job at playing the younger brother who ha always been mother s favorite and for all his success in his job and family is slowly exposed a a mama s boy the only thing that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot hole a solid connection is not really made between john s trouble and his reason for living with his mother additionally the end result of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goal and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this beatrice you must think i m some kind of moron john no i think your someone who think i m a moron beatrice well it take one to know one\n",

      "Sentence: martin scorsese s film used to intimidate me because of his reputation i felt obligated to appreciate them a deep film art rather than a great flick a much a i enjoyed them i usually felt like i missed something i learned from scorsese s casino that whatever technique he us are merely there to enhance the story no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movie for example in casino he us subtitle when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code word with each other there wa no meaning more exotic than that subtitle were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what wa really going on or toward the end when he us three quick dissolve to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building again the simple mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing i don t mean to say that his technique are not creative or good looking but he simply us the best tool for the job it shouldn t have surprised me then that kundun a film about a mystical religion actually turned out to be quite straightforward the movie follows the life of the th dalai lama the spiritual and political leader of tibet the movie s title is another name for the dalai lama which mean ocean of wisdom his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic vision to embellish the literal story one of which make an interesting statement pay attention to the film s opening shot and watch where it is repeated we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two year old his curiosity and self assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the dalai lama who have gone before several item belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other item the child is asked if he recognizes any of the item a his own the boy pick correctly proving that he is the new and the old dalai lama scorsese and long time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child wa taking his cue from the monk before selecting an item he would look at the monk perhaps for some sort of confirmation sometimes he picked right the first time and sometimes he made a second choice either way whether through reincarnation or quick human perception the tibetan were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise perceptive leader from this point on the boy is raised a the reincarnation of the lama s spirit and the future leader of a nation it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child in the u s it might be ground for a call to social service but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keep him from becoming a genuinely likeable well rounded person certain pattern take shape over the year for example the dalai lama is fascinated by technology radio clock and telescope are some of his favorite toy when he is old enough to accept his leadership he make plan to modernize isolated tibet he also ha a soft spot for creature who are suffering or in pain including herd animal it s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet s gigantic neighbor china tibet and it leader prove correct in fearing china a first the propaganda then the political pressure and finally the army come across their common border the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama s life is in danger if he stay the movie end when after much agonizing the dalai lama leaf tibet for india the story doesn t lead up to a cinematic climax a strongly a most feature film do it just doesn t fit that mold if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie perhaps more like seven year in tibet which is good in it own right the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that the structure of the film is made to fit the character and event not vice versa perhaps because the pace is slower we have more time to notice the beautiful art vestment and architecture of tibet a mandala tibetan sand painting with beautiful vibrant color is shown throughout the movie the robe and hat of state are bright red and gold the brick are a rich reddish brown not unlike the skin tone of the tibetan even the touchstone picture logo before the movie which is usually light blue is the red and gold of tibet philip glass composed the music for kundun and he wa the perfect choice for those who don t know of glass his music is like a tibetan mandala his building block are lot of small note tiny grain of music which are first grouped then repeated in pattern these pattern create interesting texture which are themselves part of a larger composition people won t be flocking to kundun for it s great ending or talking about it outstanding plot but it doe have a lot to offer an interesting lifetime exotic sight rich cinematography and innovative music it give interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and take a warm look at the dalai lama a a person on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese who give the film a strong beautiful consistent look\n",

floor and inhabits the earthling they pas out for approximately seven minute and then shrug it off a nothing because they can t even remember they blame it on a technical malfunction back on earth patrick begin to have strong urge to mate with a many woman a possible a we know from the original this is because the alien want to breed and take over the planet however the child that are bred are half human a their father is patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with and he find it in eve natasha henstridge eve wa cloned from dna taken from sil the original alien however this time around most of her alien urge have been either decreased dramatically or lie dormant the project is led by dr laura baker marg helgenberger reprising her role from specie and her motif seem respectable since she wa involved with the original alien attack she want to learn how to stop the alien should it come again and it ha story wise specie ii is much stronger than it predecessor but it is also much stronger than say alien hey i love the film but you can t tell me it wa strong on story what surprised me the most with this film wa the incorporation of historical fact into the screenplay in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college we learned about a piece of rock from mar which landed in one of the pole this piece of rock contained fossil which may have been proof of life on mar later it wa proven that it wa not a living creature that created it the script us this effectively but also manages to provide a well balanced plot beginning with the first man on mar something i have always dreamed of seeing i wa hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie and it doe it quite well the character are all smart and they know what to do and what not to do the only character that seems a little cliched is the general george dzundza and yet he remains logical in everything he doe there are the obvious flaw of course mostly lying in the technical aspect the special effect are only mediocre and some are just plain bad but for the most part they remain believable i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mother gave birth to alien child also the most realistic one are usually the goriest ranging from people being torn open or someone s head being blown off however some plot element also may elicit laugh from the audience including a menage a troi that is all but necessary many people dislike the specie series because all it is is an excuse for sex nudity and gory violence however i tend to disagree what were the alien film about and if an alien specie ever did come to earth and their sole purpose wa to destroy u wouldn t you mate a quickly a possible with a many people a possible my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick go searching for a mate in a grocery store i didn t realize that alien were that picky on choosing woman to mate with i just assume it is his part human side looking for the most beautiful one the acting is quite good for this kind of film it is a vast improvement over the first film at least the acting is the key element to this film if it wa bad it would have lowered itself into camp if it wa good it would have asked for comparison with film like alien okay so it isn t that good george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting a his over the top impersonation of a general make him annoying and distracting natasha henstridge is limited this time around a she is usually enclosed in a cage however she doe manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent oh yeah and she s quite fun to just plain watch marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around and her performance is probably the best in this film michael madsen is so so but he isn t annoying and he soon becomes rather appealing with his nice cynic personality james cromwell ha a small part but he make it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor a i say any film with james cromwell dramatically increase in likeability mykelti williamson give an enjoyable performance and he give the film a more down to earth feel and of course justin lazard lazard ha so far been ridiculed for his performance but i think he is effective sure he is wooden but isn t that what his character is like the moment when he touch the glass separating henstridge from him wa extremely well done due to the couple s acting specie ii is rated r for strong sexuality sci fi violence gore and language this is definitely an r rated film that young kid should not see more than likely they would probably have nightmare and never have sex for the rest of their life hell i don t even know if i will what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turn out to be the surprise film of the year i probably won t see another film where i wa expecting so little and got so much for quite a while director peter medak ha crafted a very suspenseful and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series medak ha also mastered the wonderful jump moment and ha probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film scream still ha the first strong acting smart dialogue intelligent plotting and a sure handed director specie ii is exactly what these film should be entertaining\n",

mind the tonight show and the home of nbc if hollywood is the center of the film world burbank is or wa the center of tv s world the world where our protagonist life combine all these name and concept into truman burbank and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world truman lead the perfect life his town his car and his wife are picture perfect his idea of reality come under attack one day when a studio light fall from the sky the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light the next day during the drive to work the radio jam and he start picking up a voice that exactly describes his movement he is so distracted that he nearly hit a pedestrian when the radio come back to normal the announcer warns listener to drive carefully his suspicion aroused he wanders around the town square looking for other oddity the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and try to take the elevator the elevator door open up on a small lounge with people on coffee break a grip see truman him and quickly move a paneled door made to look like the back of an elevator into place two security guard grab him and throw him out truman is really suspicious now it get even worse the next day when his wife a nurse describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge it s best not to think about it she say trying vainly to change truman s memory truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world you know by now that truman s life is the subject of a television program his action are real but everything else is carefully scripted from the death of his father to the choice of his wife truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is meanwhile christof the all seeing creator of truman s world doe his best to keep him unaware and happy it s sort of like westworld told from the robot point of view or jurassic park from the dinosaur point of view we root for the captive of the cage world our protagonist is counting on chaos theory to help him escape his elaborate trap the story written by andrew niccol writer director of gattaca introduces some interesting question such a the ethic of subjecting a person to this type of life or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life ha all been fake although these question came to mind i don t think the film itself asked them it certainly didn t address them or try to answer them i wa particularly disappointed that the film didn t deal more with the trauma of learning one s life is a tv show carrey s performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman s pain but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film s pacing earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well the two seemed exclusive of one another but weir and niccol didn t see it that way perhaps it s not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn t but it seems like there were some missed opportunity here but on it own term the movie is well made sight sound and pacing are all handled competently much of the first part of the movie is the truman show the scene are all apparently shot from hidden camera with snoot and obstruction covering the corner of the screen one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio the green led number obscuring the lower part of the screen the music is well chosen and scored the film open with what sound like family drama theme music when truman s world is still beautiful and perfect when the movie end the score sound more like a frantic driven tangerine dream opus while still keeping the same timbre philip glass epic music from powaqqatsi permeates truman s scene of suspicion and awakening glass ha a small cameo a a keyboardist for the show and the pacing of the story wa brisk there wa no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show just a few quick title card a few interview and then right into the show and the movie one of the first scene is of the studio light falling there wa no token scene of truman s idyllic life before it fall apart because it wasn t necessary we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble and no sooner there s also no point in the movie where the plot slows down it s a quick straight shot to the movie s end in term of overall quality i would compare the truman show to niccol s gattaca both film are well made with interesting story set in interesting world but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great idea neither film clicked and became an instant classic nevertheless i look forward to niccol s next film whatever it may be\n",

      "Sentence: and i thought stigma would be the worst religiously oriented thriller released this year turn out i wa wrong because while stigma wa merely boring and self important end of day is completely inept on all front it s a silly incomprehensible endlessly stupid mess for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best it s extremely disconcerting to see where the big man ha ended up for the first time in recent memory an arnold action movie and batman robin doesn t count is no fun at all end of day is a major stinker the movie open in vatican city some catholic priest have observed an ancient prophecy which say that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation if he impregnates her between and midnight on december the world will be destroyed the pope order protection of this girl though some priest believe she ought to be killed in new york that very night a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy twenty year later we meet jericho cane schwarzenegger a suicidal ex cop with a drinking problem now working a a security guard for hire he is protecting a local businessman gabriel byrne who is actually possessed by the devil an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest lead him to the girl satan is after christine york robin tunney recognizing element of his own murdered daughter in christine including ownership of the same music box apparently jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priest looking to kill her there are so many problem with this film it s hard to know where to begin but how about starting with the concept casting arnold in a role like this wa a mistake to begin with schwarzenegger is a persona not an actor so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea arnold ha neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotion in other word trying to give him dimension wa a mistake harrison ford mel gibson or even bruce willis could have played this role they ve all played noble and flawed hero but not schwarzenegger there are several scene that attempt to establish jericho s character one ha him contemplating suicide another cry over the loss of his wife and daughter and even one in which the devil try to tempt him into revealing christine s location by offering him his old life back none of these scene really work because arnie isn t up to the task the filmmaker would have been better off making jericho a strong confident character like the terminator for example the like of which schwarzenegger ha excelled in before this one isn t at all believable the way arnold play him the supporting cast try their hardest and only gabriel byrne make any impact at all a the prince of darkness he s suave and confident he act like one would expect the devil to act the problem is that the script ha him doing thing that make no sense more on that later and that undermines him a a powerful villain byrne out performs arnold in every scene they have together including the aforementioned temptation bit but this is problematic when it cause the audience to start doing the unthinkable root for the devil byrne s speech about the bible being overrated actually start to make sense mainly because arnold s attempt at refuting it mostly of the ti not variety are feeble at best the only problem is arnold ha to win so in the end nobody really care kevin pollack play jericho s security guard sidekick and try to liven thing up with some comic aside but like most bad action movie sidekick he disappears after about an hour robin tunney isn t given much to do except look scared in fact all of the supporting player are good actor but none save for byrne is given anything interesting to do performance aside it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it this being an action blockbuster it s no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script which start off totally confusing and when some of it is explained and not much of it is it s utterly ridiculous why is the devil coming on new year s eve because it s exactly year after the year of the devil which isn t it turn out some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down so the real year is so just add a to the beginning and you ve got if you don t buy this explanation you re not alone it s convoluted and silly at the same time the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous she s christine see and she life in new york see and if that weren t bad enough there s plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn t explained at all why can satan kill everyone he pass on the street but when it come to snuffing out one drunk ex cop he s powerless is he impervious to only one kind of bullet how come he can t control jericho or christine and how did those gregorian monk deal with time zone in their prophecy a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this but it s never actually explained usually this sort of thing wouldn t matter in a schwarzenegger flick i mean don t get me started on the time paradox offered up by the terminator movie but this time the plot inconsistency stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting there are several predictable horror film clich s present in end of day complete with the old black cat hiding in a cabinet bit not that we ever find out what the cat wa doing in there it get so formulaic that it s possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eye at the precise moment a boo will come their prediction will rarely be wrong the more grandiose action sequence are utterly charmless partially because we don t care about these character due to the script s pathetic attempt at characterization and setup and also because they too don t make any sense there s a scene where schwarzenegger get thrown around a room by a little old lady it s good for a few chuckle but not much else supposedly we re to believe she now ha super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan but the script never set that up so the scene is merely silly none of this is terribly exciting because all the action sequence are so badly framed that it s often hard to tell why it s happening in the first place not to mention that they re edited in full on incomprehensible mtv quick cut style most of them had me scratching my head rather than saying wow cool end of day is not only silly and confusing but it s also distinctly unpleasant to watch the devil apparently doesn t operate in the more subtle i ll convince people to kill each other fashion outlined in the bible but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight this doesn t only make him an awfully predictable sort but it also mean that not a single scene in end of day go by without unnecessarily graphic violence or the odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit that had me scratching my head if violence is supposed to be shocking it s not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience go numb scene aren t connected through any reasonable mean so a lot of the time stuff get blown up or people get killed and i had no idea why reason to hell with reason let s just blow stuff up isn t it cool nope not by a long shot this film is thoroughly unwatchable it s dull interminable and unrelenting in it stupidity perhaps arnold need to make some movie with james cameron to revive his career because it s not happening with hack peter hyams here end of day might have had camp value if only it didn t top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody s going to buy if the movie is going to be serious the filmmaker should have come up with a decent script if it s going to be campy arnold shouldn t be taking himself so damn seriously i didn t actually see him put up on a cross did i and his character shouldn t be such a sad sack a it stand end of day is just a bad movie and an awfully gloomy one at that\n",

preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter i chuckled incessantly all the way home let me share the skull is a secret society conceived inside the wall of yale designed i m sure to mirror the actual skull bone from the same college luke mcnamara joshua jackson a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year highlight the latest skull scouting report despite some anxiety and caution from others luke accepts entry into the organization soon after he find himself surrounded by beautiful woman driving a new car and marveling at the that somehow surfaced in his bank account yeah dude pretty good deal eh but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating when circumstance become extreme there is no way he can leave the society except maybe a a drooling vegetable the premise although lacking in originality certainly offer it share of potential intrigue and suspense unfortunately the skull is neither intriguing nor suspenseful nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting it s just another abysmal teen prototype that ha the soundtrack the star but not the script the skull is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value with the screenplay by jon pogue immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howler first off upon their initiation into the skull each new member ha to have a skull branded onto their arm afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently cover up the scar will they never take this watch off and what if they forget it by their bedside perhaps their secret society wa being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new member like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed on top of this they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters gee why not member t shirt but my favorite bit is this the voting committee for the skull doe not bother with individual agree or disagree notion when making collective decision they are given official skull paddle when flipped to one side they indicate the member agrees with the proposal facing the opposite way mean a disagreement wouldn t they merely express themselves verbally hell no they have to retrieve the paddle for a proper vote and maybe afterward they can play ping pong i m still chuckling about these ludicrous detail but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest the cast meanwhile combine a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the dawson s creek crowd and fuse the two together ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout but not entirely accomplished actor like craig t nelson a skull chairman judge litten mandrake and william peterson a fellow board member senator levritt are dealt pathetic villain caricature and look suitably embarrassed handling them and then there s christopher mcdonald who ha the capacity to be a fun exciting actor mcdonald s charisma is totally diminished here a he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role yes pogue make it a hat trick i pray it wa a snatch the paycheck and run exercise for all these actor the young troupe of performer involved fair moderately better let s cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character paul walker the strapping quarterback from varsity blue is bland but passable a caleb mandrake the judge s son walker preserve a straight face even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie dad i just killed a guy in the ritual room some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb who play luke s longtime chum chloe and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics it really boil down to the

      "Sentence: written by alex cox tod davy terry gilliam and tony grisoni directed by terry gilliam i ve always preferred mushroom to blotter acid dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded you have no idea where the peak and valley are no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat and no idea how long the ride will last then there s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine laced dose mushroom on the other hand offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel a steady reassuring assent a short period of thrilling motion and color and then a smooth landing acid is for daredevil mushroom are for refined seeker of joy my point is that in fear and loathing in la vega director terry gilliam ha made an acid movie when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie full of shocking sight gag aggressive image and grotesque comic performance the film certainly offer something for those fan of hunter s thompson s book who want to experience it twisted pharmacological world view from the inside out but for those of u who just want to enjoy a well made film gilliam ha produced a mixed bag fear and loathing tell the ostensibly true story of how self professed gonzo journalist hunter s thompson johnny depp and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta benicio del toro came to la vega to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of mean in operating under the pseudonym of raoul duke and dr gonzo the two men careen into vega on an acid and mescaline bender then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite cocaine tequila and a rainbow of multi colored upper and downer they terrorize every one they meet mostly because every one they meet terrifies them duke hallucinates giant bat on the way into town then is attacked by horrifying lizard in the casino lounge dr gonzo becomes enamored of a thick bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just a jefferson airplane s white rabbit reach it climax and these guy don t just trash hotel room they rape them humiliate them and leave them for dead that neither of them end up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence depending on your point of view thompson s book besides being a hilarious read ha stood the test of time a an important historical document it simultaneously exposed the s drug culture for the sham that it wa and exposed la vega a the place where the american dream came to die pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson s message but the truth is that stripped to it bare essential what gilliam ha wrought is a drug comedy it s a cheech and chong movie you re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemical and then laugh at the result see johnny take drug see johnny fall down there s nothing wrong with this concept but gilliam try too hard this is a frantic movie all sweaty close ups wide angle lens dutch tilt and other worldly lighting scheme there are time when gilliam really doe put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen but to what end much of the dialogue come verbatim from thompson s book and there are some priceless comic observation but you re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work this brings u to the performance which strike me a all wrong depp play thompson a groucho mark filtered through george c scott in patton a gimmicky performance which work against the biting satire of thompson s dialogue in between his several puking scene del toro fare better a dr gonzo but he also mumble and sputter so many of his line that their weight is lost watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty year ago with dan akroyd and john belushi a the lead now that would have been something to see it s interesting to note that alex cox credited a a co writer on the screenplay wa originally slated to direct before gilliam took over a much of a fan a i am of gilliam s work cox would have been the better choice sid and nancy cox s best work covered essentially the same subject matter but cox wa able to pull back and allow the character of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film gilliam commits the compound sin of over directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose what kind of movie wa he trying to make anyway it doesn t try to be a cautionary tale and it doesn t work a broad comedy if he had considered more carefully his purpose the result would have been a much more interesting film but i don t want to be too hard on it there are some truly funny moment and if you re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it i do however recommend watching fear and loathing in la vega under the influence of your favorite controlled substance i guarantee it will enhance the effect\n",

i will try to vary word description of sex meaning if you are offended by pejorative term and or your name is jerry falwell you are kindly invited to hit the up on the left corner of your screen so if there happens to be a word you come across and can not comprehend fret not it s most likely just another way of referring to sex i think we d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review though not a boring a the movie which make steve forbes flat tax plan seem a lively a watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongo while high on god know what body shot is a film so frightened of coitus that scene of copulation are filmed ominously in the way you d normally expect to see a violent attack it s about people who think about screwing seek it out and talk about it these are thing we all do sometimes the character in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicity of sexual act their life center around the next sexual encounter but they seemed depressed it s a if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek at it core body shot is a message movie the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church group showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition michael cristoffer who directed gia another film that treated bumping ugli a if it where evil is a moralist with nothing new to say his character don t communicate anything of interest to each other so cristoffer give them an opportunity to let out their inner thought by speaking directly into the camera they voice simplistic platitude like i like to come or sex without love equal violence huh and yes that is a complex a this movie s observation get the character are stupid and shallow with not one registering a anything more the plot concern vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure then the after math the morning after of such event we meet the character a they speak directly to u confiding in u with their idiotic rumination on intimacy i would normally go into the character and the actor who play them giving you the pro and con but for this film i can not i m not trying to be clever or witty but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others with the exception of trent played by ron livingston a a bargain basement patrick bateman the rest fade into each other a patchwork of fake breast defined ab pearly white teeth and creamy flawless skin i vaguely recall brad rowe a the sensitive one only because his character get the worst line sex without love equal violence in between all the confessional cristoffer film everything like a headache commercial with blurry slo mo and dramatic head turning the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffle me this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that it tag line claim to be defining if body shot is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f k obsessed fine i don t have any problem with a film that try to persuade me to think a certain way but cristoffer only give u one side additionally that one side isn t even entertaining the character indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness or realism one sexual encounter take place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive character they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ala if it could only be that easy kidding of course then not only isn t it erotic it isn t real it doesn t feel like an authentic sexual encounter every f k scene in this film and there are many is treated in the same unsexy manner body shot make fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film it show u none of the pleasure that should go along with it and most of all it fails to show u why it character love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it the resulting search for nookie and you can take that cookie over one night leaf u with several tedious plot line to follow the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred the film show u two separate version of the possible rape one where it is consensual the other where it is not and in both version the young actress playing the possible victim get her shirt torn off this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently and if memory serf me i can t think of one film that ha done so and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movie of the s next to wall street unfortunately nobody give u reason to care not the writer the director or the actor nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious spin off paul thomas anderson approached boogie night in a manner similar to what cristoffer doe here though boogie night succeeded it wa similarly moralistic but it gave u two different viewpoint it showed u how the lifestyle of porn enticed it character and it showed u the possible fall out of such a decision the character in boogie night were a idiotic a the character are here but anderson seemed to care about them he gave them heart cristoffer give them nothing but raging hormone he preaches to u by using his character to preach to u this is not the way to get any message across why not just direct a public service announcement on the peril of hittin

directed by diane keaton make me laugh again not only is hanging up misadvertised since the film wholeheartedly focus on middle sister meg ryan and give her two co star lisa kudrow and diane keaton little more than extended cameo but they don t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minute and we are supposed to believe their strong bond and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship despite them being apart for the majority of the running time excuse me again while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion eve mark meg ryan is the middle mozzell sister still living in the california town where she grew up and with a husband adam arkin and pre teen son jesse james her elderly wisecracking father lou walter matthau in his brightest performance in year ha just recently been put into the hospital in the final stage of what i assume is alzheimer s even though the film never enlightens u on exactly what is wrong with him while eve s relationship with her mother cloris leachman is nearly nonexistent since she ran out on lou and her child year ago she ha had her fair share of up s and down s with lou who used to be an alcoholic her older sister is georgia diane keaton an editor for the self titled magazine georgia while maddy lisa kudrow is the youngest a soap opera actress interestingly their profession are given but we not once ever see them working at their job or for that matter learn much of anything about them maddy georgia and eve do not see each other much anymore their adult life gradually causing them to drift apart but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another and they talk and talk and talk in fact the telephone is the major star of the film even more so than ryan a it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable minute catastrophe that feel like it three hour long if you are able to get through the opening half hour in which phone ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them you will surely survive the rest the question is who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating self involved pat on the back how could a comedy drama that ha the star power of meg ryan lisa kudrow and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different way issue from the past involving the possible jealousy each ha had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up but the film isn t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood it is a lost cause that come off a nothing more than an afterthought also it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sister have with one another but no dynamic metamorphosizes and when they do reunite in the finale their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three minute scene in which they argue like little child you can see the impending death coming a mile away and it conveniently occurs in the next scene so that the three can quickly come to term with themselves and with each other you think to yourself the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food fight and like clockwork it also occurs by the end credit meg ryan is a versatile actress look no further than s hurlyburly or s when a man love a woman despite her various detractor who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedy with hanging up the only thing she need to do is completely sever her filmmaking tie with nora ephron a writer director hack who shouldn t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big budget high profile debacle even if she knew what she wa making wa not exactly up to par in the quality department she nonetheless is very good and the two scene that work flashback to christmas when she had a heartbreaking run in with her mother and to halloween when lou crashed her son s birthday party in a drunken stupor are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situation diane keaton a georgia is better a an actress than a director here but that is a wildly feeble compliment what is more than a little far fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow although in the very brief glimpse we get at them a child she is no more than five year ryan s senior yeah right lastly poor lisa kudrow ha been wasted once again in a big screen venture after her even more thin role in s analyze this kudrow isn t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy so it isn t her fault she doesn t register until a few quiet moment sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue if anything though kudrow is a real talent and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time a in her brilliantly nuanced oscar caliber work in s the opposite of sex if you are a fan of kudrow s and who isn t do yourself a favor and rent this gem that put more good use to kudrow in sixty second than hanging up doe in it entirety a eve s hardworking husband adam arkin is predictably squandered with a role that give him next to nothing to do until a subplot reveals itself midway through only to never be mentioned again cloris leachman a with ryan and matthau make a small but noticeable impression with her albeit very brief appearance while edie mcclurg a a rosy cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas flashback manages one of the few laugh in this otherwise joyless production nearly all the emotion displayed within hanging up are patently manufactured and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the character aside from eve why would you want to when they are all spoiled brat if for some bizarre twilight zone type of reason you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credit are over saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of

dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation s project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility for what purpose is never hinted at they ve performed several experiment on animal and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine in a twist worthy of the film s s late show origin to impulsively experiment on himself caine neglect to let the pentagon in on his plan and somehow get two of his co worker to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead our mad scientist is turned invisible after several fx heavy complication then he inexplicably it s hinted that the process of invisibility ha made the animal into more savage creature but this is never explored and if that wa the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human begin raping assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it s verhoeven s film that have become hollow like the rest this one is cold heartless and full of contempt for humanity but in addition to all that it lack any trace of wit insight and make no statement other than audience will pay for anything these day it s an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun thrill a minute ride verhoeven ha instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care the preview make hollow man look like an irresistible flick how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self a couple week ago after seeing the trailer a bunch of friend and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flick never go so far a to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa in a serious manner to boot but oh yeah it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway verhoeven delivers the sleazy good but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner here it just feel icky and uncomfortable the director keep his camera trained at his nubile actress caressing their breast with his lens all while faux psycho music strain in the background it s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn t exploring voyeurism like in the classic peeping tom but exploiting it and not even doing that very well it s funny that with all the technology million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply a gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein character do stupid thing just so the villain can pop up for more attack in fact it s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since by the end most of his potential victim don infer red glass that track his body heat a in every mad slasher film we get the killer pov a scene where he spy on his neighbor while she undress triggered unpleasant memory of party massacre and lot of scene where people are unknowingly stalked the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy it happens when a lab assistant kim dickens who look like she stepped out of playboy in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon suddenly pause are you looking at me she query obviously haunted it s a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effect set to a plot that should have run it course by the apex of the mad slasher craze those special effect are so stunning they alone keep this from being a bad a urban legend or i still know what you did last summer and they re the only reason to check out hollow man preferably a a mid week bargain rental you ve been warned but you probably won t listen will you ti

      "Sentence: tarzan and the lost city is one of the most anemic movie to come out in quite a while not only it is poorly written badly acted and generally incompetent in all cinematic area it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid unfortunately it s not bad in the way great colossal misfire like heaven s gate or ishtar were bad instead it literally drip off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with which begs the question of why it wa made in the first place with all the good script lying around hollywood un produced how doe needless drek like this make it way to the big screen of course tarzan is one of the most filmed character in all of motion picture history he ha appeared in over forty film which have ranged from the very good s greystoke the legend of tarzan lord of the ape down to the really bad s tarzan the ape man with bo derek most of these film were just cheapie b movie made in the thirty and forty starring ex olympic athlete and a lot of cutsie chimp therefore if another tarzan movie is to be made one might assume that it would have something new to offer a different angle an original storyline anything to set it apart from all the others greystoke added a never before seen level of realism to the pulpy tale and even tarzan the ape man at least had the mi guided audacity to sexualize the story a a vehicle for bo derek s bare breast tarzan and the lost city on the other hand ha absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storyline and bad dialogue the script by bayard johnson and j anderson black is about a formulaic and generic a they come comic book have better plot than this the movie is so bad in fact that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that wa so tirelessly mocked in last summer s comedy george of the jungle didn t the producer think to leave that back in the old weissmuller picture where it belongs the story start with the legend of tarzan already firmly established a quick opening narration tell of tarzan casper van dien being found in the jungle after having been raised by ape and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage when the movie start in he is a civilized english gentleman without an english accent and he is to marry jane jane march in less than a week however when a wicked archeologist grave robber named nigel raven steve waddington begin hunting for the fabled lost city of opar one of africa s last great secret the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle at first jane refuse to go pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding but after tarzan leaf she change her mind and track him down therefore assuring lot of lame smooch scene between her and her ape man once the film get going in it own sluggish way it delf into a series of jungle adventure a tarzan jane and the native attempt the thwart raven and his crew from discovering the city most of the so called adventure are cheesy predictable and unexciting with no pace tension or action to speak of there are sequence stolen from innumerable recent adventure movie ranging from raider of the lost ark to the goony when the movie is running short on action it includes a few greenpeace friendly scene of tarzan freeing caged animal releasing a baby elephant from a trap and throwing ivory tusk into the river the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality for instance when tarzan who wa raised in the jungle is bit by a cobra he doesn t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi experienced weekend backpacker would do instead he tie a tourniquet around his arm and stumble off into the jungle with no plan for survival of course one can t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is not to ruin the ending or anything but there is no lost city there is however a lost pyramid which i suppose is all the resource strapped fx department could come up with the special effect are not worthy of a made for tv movie which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunter had to slog through numerous underground cavern to get to the lost pyramid when it s sitting right out in the middle of an open field strictly speaking tarzan and the lost city isn t even bad enough to have camp quality although casper van dien s laughably stiff performance come real close this movie prof what starship trooper only hinted at he can not act but he sure look well groomed even in the deepest heart of the african jungle van dien is much too much of a pretty boy to be an effective tarzan he s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth i also wondered what the make up department wa thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa steve perry haircut waddington make a decent villain although he s like a charmless version of belloq from raider of the lost ark a jane the ex model jane march ha little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan she doe fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunter a time or two but whenever a snake come into the picture she is reduced to a hysterical mess however amidst all this complaining i do have one piece of good news tarzan and the lost city is so lacking in idea both new and old that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid so we can say this much for it at least it had the decency to be short\n",

      "Sentence: i went to blair witch project book of shadow with the highest of hope the original film released last summer wa genuinely scary and terrifying i hoped that this movie would live up to it predecessor unfortunately my hope were soon dashed a the movie open the audience is shown pseudo documentary clip of burkittsville maryland resident being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town a a result of the original blair witch project movie it s a mostly humorous self aware poke at the medium hype and hysteria surrounding the first film during this segment we are introduced to the protagonist a young man who sell blair witch related memorabilia from his website the movie then cut to a title that informs u that what we are about to see occurred one year previously we see the same young man that wa selling blair witch paraphernalia but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only find in bad horror movie we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette smoking doctor luridly leer above him we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room we see him cowering naked in a shower stall a a fire hose is turned on him no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution in fact these scene are barely referred to again i had a sinking feeling during these opening scene generally a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting filthy interior and evil doctor is a sure sign that you are in the throe of a truly horrible movie the movie cut again this time to the present the young man whose name is jeffrey played by jeffrey donovan a in the first movie the character name are identical to the actor name although this movie admits up front that it is fictional so there s no reason for the practice this time around is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the wood that weekend for the blair witch hunt which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sell on his website we meet tristen and steven a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience steven is a skeptic believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria tristen on the other hand belief that there may be some truth to the rumor of supernatural occurrence she is wan and soft spoken she complains that the radio is playing too loudly she also complains that she feel nauseated i knew immediately that the character wa pregnant and my intuition wa confirmed a few scene later when kim psychomagically susses it out how did i know because in bad movie nauseated woman are always pregnant the fourth member of their party is erica a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eye who want to prove that the blair witch wa a good witch not evil they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery kim is dressed completely in black ha extreme goth style makeup on and occasionally display seemingly psychic ability but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect it s never explained the party of five head off into the wood a promised they reach the crumbling ruin of the foundation of rustin parr s house and set up camp complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night s event there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site a well but after a few word are exchanged the rival group huff off and make camp elsewhere the movie veers off at this point to spend many long long minute showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun go down sexual innuendo are tossed around much hard liquor beer and pot is consumed and nothing much else happens this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary the next day the team wake up and discovers that their camera equipment ha been completely trashed and that steven and tristen s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shred like snow the videotape are missing but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim they discover the videotape buried underneath the foundation of the house right where the original blair witch tape were found ooh spooky the team go back to jeffrey s house a creepy old civil war era warehouse in the heart of the wood to regroup and review the tape they soon discover that the tape mysteriously skip five hour of the night wacky hijinks ensue tristen start having weird dream in which she is the blair witch everybody start finding these weird rune like burn mark on their body steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucination and everything pretty much go to hell in a handbasket throughout the entire ordeal jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotape which seem to have some kind of weird image on them at about the point that the time jump eventually tristen wanders in mutter something about reverse and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tape backwards when they do this they discover what really happened during the five lost hour one of the thing they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotape okay if the videotape were being buried then how were they recording themselves oh nevermind this movie wa awful simply awful the character are broadly drawn caricature that are never allowed any depth or development erica is the nature loving wiccan tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman steven is the overbearing asshole kim is the antisocial goth girl old tired cliche were used to illustrate these caricature how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic because she s pregnant how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl because she wear a lot of eye makeup how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy because he ha jagged teeth and talk like he s straight out of deliverance this is weak storytelling at it worst rather than taking the time to flesh out the character and make them truly sympathetic the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristic in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action it didn t work on top of being poorly developed most of the character were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid honey you just had a miscarriage out in the wood and got medical attention at a hospital that look like it belongs in a bad slasher movie let s get on a plane home no i am having these bizarre nightmare and seeing strange vision and i want to find out what s going on ok frankly by the end of the movie i wa rooting for the witch i also felt that there wa simply too much blood n gore in this film the first movie worked by never showing u the horror the witch wa a palpable presence in that movie but we never saw it we never saw anything in fact the horror wa all off screen and thus our imagination worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie blair witch dispensed with such nicety and went straight for the gross out this wa evident from the opening scene of the mad doctor forcing white goo down jeffrey s throat and continued throughout the film a the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort knife plunge into flesh bloody finger trail off into the darkness and none of it is explained until the very end when it wa too late for me to care this movie didn t stop with showing u the gore either it went for broke and showed u everything by the end of the movie there are no question remaining about the missing five hour it is all explained in fact it is all shown on screen in loving detail i confess to being someone who prefers horror movie in which you never see the monster or see only brief glimpse mere suggestion of what the monster is it is not because i find the monster so terrifying but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying i have seen interview with the director in which he suggested that there is no monster that all of the evil wa perpetrated only by the human mind i found this to be a miserably poor explanation if it wa in fact the director s intent then he need to have some word with the writer because it wa not made clear at all i know a lot of people who like to go to party and get drunk and stoned out of their mind none of them ha ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucination with a group of other people for the next week or so and if there wa no witch then what about the vanishing tree the snowfall of manuscript paper hm blair witch book of shadow wa a horrible movie from the poorly written character to the implausible story to the plot inconsistency to the gross out shot it wa a bad effort through and through\n",

laugh from ultra serious jack webb when there wa nothing else on tv even though dragnet is out of circulation at the moment we webb anti fan still have the d i a s propaganda piece for the military that is almost a hilarious a the famous blue boy episode of dragnet for anyone like me who got laugh out of webb s rapid fire speech and straight faced seriousness think of the d i a what would happen if sgt joe friday ever enlisted because he play exactly the same character here a no nonsense old fart who look with disdain at the younger generation and love to give long winded melodramatic speech on any topic in this election year i m more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth the movie open in characteristic fashion a one recruit after another knock on webb s office door and enters he give each one a different series of cranky criticism before the credit come up the produced and directed by jack webb card pretty much go without saying this is his movie all the way and after the first twenty minute of him chewing out his recruit for no reason i wa wondering if there would even be a plot i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rant but the d i give u more much more webb s mission is to make a man out of private owen the local screw up the captain give webb three day to convert owen into marine material or the captain will personally cut the lace off his panty and ship him out myself whether the lace panty part refers to webb or owen remains unanswered this of course give webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owen life a living hell for those of you who haven t been indoctrinated into the pleasure of webb watching here s a reprint of a typical monologue of his i can t duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper but the word should at least partially convey what i m talking about now you listen to me youngster someday you ll wake up fighting on a beach and you ll pray to god somebody doesn t get killed because of your foolishness i ve got a headline for you every time you make one of those little mistake of yours you re gon na turn around and i ll be standing right there i couldn t write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d i nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy line like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day s work by going to the local bar where he order a tomato juice he meet a woman who coincidentally also order tomato juice but walk away from a typically stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch rival another marine d i webb march over to the table get up in her face and say just what kind of a dame do you think you are bogart he ain t the other d i get one of the few memorable non webb line when he confesses to the girl he s a damn good d i i guess i m just a little jealous join the club we re all jealous of jack webb s way with woman which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene a webb find his way to the woman s place of employment a lingerie store and stand around looking incredibly flustered at the negligee on display you expect me to talk to you in he exclaims no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bra the woman go off to help a customer leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen a little girl spot him in the store and demand what are you doing in here you re a man aren t you he doesn t reply but you know he s thinking in his head what an odd specie of human so small must be one of those child everyone s been talking about this poor girl scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb would later swear off the male gender entirely just one of the many lesbian conversion he s responsible for the movie doesn t focus too closely on webb s romance it also continues the owen subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie where webb force his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owen killed during one of their drill after two private hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea webb asks owen wa that flea you killed a male or female owen reply a male sir webb yell to the platoon this ain t the one that such a scene along with the rest of the movie wa intended to be taken seriously defies comment but we know it wa all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marine not only for their cooperation in the making of the d i but for iwo jima guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the th century webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldier in the movie with the exception of owen were played by actual marine someone wanting to parody this movie couldn t do a more comical job than webb did it make it all the more ironic like raeeyain on your wedding day that the man had no sense of humor himself there s a scene in the movie where the guy are on their break time discussing something and one of them break into laughter webb burst in the room and shout what did i tell you about laughing to which the private reply sir only

      "Sentence: note some may consider portion of the following text to be spoiler be forewarned at the end of the day those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avenger would do well to take note that warning cloud loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screening and scrapped plan for a gala premiere this highly anticipated film rendition of the cult television show wa originally slotted for an early june opening where it would have gone head to head against the rival studio heavy hitter it eventual demotion to a less potent mid august opening wa an obvious early indication of the studio s lack of confidence with the picture and with good reason this is a joyless exercise of a film held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement thrill or wit remarkable in it banality and brutally uninvolving the avenger is a catastrophic mess which immediately invite comparison to last year s case study in style over substance joel schumacher s much loathed batman robin indeed both film even feature appalling ridiculous sequence which find central character dressed up in fuzzy oversized costume uma thurman who take on the salacious role of the catsuit clad karate chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg wa the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audience something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage unfortunately the same can t be said here where she and cohort ralph fiennes our new john steed taking over for patrick macnee demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever fatally crippling the picture a they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actor painfully aware that they re on board a sinking ship at this rate usually splendid actor mr fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man his tepid turn here will make a much of an inroad a his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange day the duo look the part and admittedly the avenger is more than most heavily dependent upon style but they re no fun to watch and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic character a they navigated through the picture s caper esque plot when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmaker chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma a our mr peel no not kate beckinsale although the notion now intrigue me but gwyneth paltrow who wa originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot on english accent if nothing else it d at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt the story such a it is involves the ever bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter sean connery an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate controlling contraption they also sip a lot of tea overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonist superior it sound far better than it play and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post production tinkering it s clearly evident that the picture ha been cut to shred the avenger wa never about gripping drama and our hero accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac it s all decidedly uncompelling mr connery who s onscreen barely long enough to register an impression approach the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest at least it all look good this is a genuinely handsome production with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt in particular the gleaming production design by stuart craig command attention adeptly drawing element both old and new in order to depict this great britain there are a handful of striking visual moment in the film including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bee and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instance fail to stir interest or raise pulse rate by the time the film s climax had arrived my interest wa not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing wave and thundering rain but with the quickest escape route from the theatre not coincidentally the enticing bit of visual bravura were the shot assembled into the movie s remarkable trailer a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself the first promo which made the round in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year it s everything that the avenger is not saucy clever engaging and entertaining a crushing disappointment the film is one of the worst outing of the year too drearily awful to be savoured a gleefully bad too polished to overlook it deficiency there may be upcoming picture that are even more lifeless than the avenger but i sure hope not\n",

      "Sentence: m i the sequel to mission impossible is a james bond wannabe film but it fails to even come close to that film in wit humor and entertainment value it try to be a spy romance movie but without any suspense the film just look like it s an extended commercial for dude who think they look cool in throwaway sunglass it is a film that prefers techie gadget to anything human the coolest thing about this movie wa all the hole it had in it story and the most trite thing about the movie wa the usage of dove throughout a peace symbol the film play a if it wa a wet fantasy dream about techie violence except for the choreographed action sequence the film wa dull for three quarter of it time filled with too many dead spot in it story to garner concern about it wooden character or the superficial romance that developed a for the action scene they might look good to those who are convert to violence in their film but their advertisement for sadistic response is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence which make it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen m i open and close with fast paced action scene but it is hard to get past the part which just drag on in banal dialogue the film look a if it had been invaded by a computer virus at that point the only thing that kept me awake wa the horrible music composed by han zimmer that became very loud at any of the film s supposedly momentous action scene and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way it s a mega buck film adapted from a popular high tech gadgetry tv series but it artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actor to star in it and it failed to produce a story that had any substance john woo broken arrow face off is good at doing car chase choreographed fight with midair flip and kung fu kick slo mo shot of two gun blazing and of fire explosion but he just can t seem to handle dialogue and suspense the star of the film and co producer tom cruise and his romantic interest thandie newton are miscast cruise is no james bond and look more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile a he try to carry off this macho role while thandie is not an action film girl and seems like a fish out of water in this one their romance didn t work not only wa it tepid and not sexy but it wasn t convincing the film open with dizzying speed perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is it best bet for success we will be in three different location instantaneously sydney the american southwest and seville first we are in sydney australia where a scientist with a muffled russian accent dr nekhorvich rade mention that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it he also mention that every hero need a worthy villain which explains the film s mythic theme a we enter the world of comic book myth on good and evil the one who played the villain dougray scott doe so in a one dimensional gruff tone which did not distinguish him in that role at least if the film got the villain part right it might have had some fun with this nonsense soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trust called dimitri but then the plane is taken over by terrorist who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountain before they crash the plane and parachute out of it the one who wa posing a dimitri turn out to be sean ambrose scott a rogue member of the imf which is a cia like clone he steal the package with the antidote peel off a latex mask which is a replica of the hero of the story ethan hunt cruise who had posed a dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust sean and his group of terrorist carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victim the antidote at marked up price we already saw the gimmick of peeling mask used in face off and in the original mission impossible which a convoluted a plot a that film had it wa still a superior film to this sequel woo ha run this peeling mask routine into the ground a it is used so often in this film by both side so much so that it blur any ethical character difference between good guy or villain it make it seem a if anyone could be another character which distorts the reality of the film and make it impossible for the film to make much sense next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest and ethan is on vacation hanging by his fingertip while climbing and looking cool when a helicopter with his bos anthony hopkins aboard delivers via a rocket launcher a pair of talking sunglass hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agent to help billy baird john polson and luther stickell ving rhames with luther running a high gadget computer but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall thandie to join his team he is told a an incentive to recruit her all her criminal charge will be dropped hopkins then sign off with the tag line this message will self destruct in five second actually with the departure of hopkins it wa this disposable film that actually self destructed at this point in seville hunt recruit nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase where he nearly run her audi sport car over the side of a mountain road he also fall for her when this wa only supposed to be a business deal and learns that she is valuable because her ex boyfriend wa sean ambrose and that he still want to f ck her the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f ck him a she lead them to his hide out in the seaside of australia in which he share with his sneering villainous cohort the south african hugh stamp richard roxburgh robert towne the screenwriter who contributed to the first mission who is noted for doing chinatown writes a colorless pedestrian script one that fails even to be funny in a camp way the terrorist who aim to rule the world are interested in owning percent in a biotech company and in getting stock option a they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote insuring that they will make billion on the stock ethan come to the rescue of the world and of nyah with his only conflict being who is more important to save first ethan doe this rescue against all odds a he find a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company fight it out with sean and the other terrorist and rescue nyah who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean s getting it a the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle ethan rescue her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle using kick boxing winning a shootout throwing a full john wayne supply of grenade at the terrorist making some more use out of that peeling mask bit and by being completely fearless and larger than life while he kick s everyone s as if i wa only entertained by this i could have lived with it but this film wa so badly made that it wa like watching a highlight film of a basketball game seeing only the slam dunk but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast in any case this is a critic proof film and will in all probability do well in the box office a it wa made to appeal to all the demographic who find commercial venture like this one easy to buy into\n",

      "Sentence: the most interesting part of can t hardly wait just happens to be not only the most human but for many of u the one part that many of u can easily relate to that is the character of denise lauren ambrose the film s sole sarcastic member who mock everything that go on in the film and at one point sits down on a couch and look totally bored the film wisely hold over this moment nicely showing her alienation in the midst of a large high school party almost too nicely for some member of the audience read me this is basically a mirror of what s going on with them watching this film we sit there wondering why we ve even bothered to see a film about a long high school party we probably never felt the desire to go to in the first place i would actually highly recommend this film if it satirized all of this after all this film is filled with a bunch of pathetic stereotype much of which i went to high school with everyone s here the jock the homecoming queen the nerd and his dominion of trekkies and x philes the alienated wannabe writer the school spirit girl the pothead s the wigger etc etc etc and weirdly enough this film show them a superficial lame and basically a a bunch of loser except for denise who roll her eye at everything and easily becomes the most likable character even before she speaks her yearbook entry something which is done for each main character quote oscar wilde definite pointer there unfortunately the writer and director take several major misteps on the way to making this into an admirable and even likable film the film a i said portrays most of it character a superficial and just totally ignorant to everything however instead of sticking with this perhaps even going a bit further with it they let this lie and actually make these character into our hero we follow several of them all a bunch of moronic stereotype with only a shread of humanity and realism and try to tell boring and overly melodramatic tale about them a if we actually cared and or identified with them and if we did we certainly don t want to revisit that state of being here s a quick low down it s graduation and we follow a bunch of senior on the last night otherwise known a the american grafitti or to a lesser extent the dazed and confused cliche the formal just followed them a they drove aimlessly the latter did a little bit of that and featured a big outdoor keg party can t hardly wait just opts for a big indoor keg party and a little bit of aimless driving albeit of the i m whining because i can t get a girl i want brand we follow many people around but mostly we trail preston ethan embry of that thing you do the alienated writer who s been pining over the homcoming queen amanda the totally overrated jennifer love hewitt for the entirety of high school because he think they shared a moment their freshman year over a freaking pop tart now that she s broken up with her football player boyfriend mike peter facinelli he decides to go to the party with a note he s written declaring his love for her in the hope he ll build up the gut to give it to her even though he s leaving for a multi week intensive writing program hosted by none other than kurt vonnegut okay the ingenius vonnegut or some icky noxema spokesperson since that plot is incredibly lame and a track record of what go on with it wouldn t be able to carry a commercial let alone a feature film and because it s a party there are some more main character such a william charlie finally surfacing after dick tracy the nerd and his dominion who ha come up with a ridiculous plan to publically sabotage mike who s humiliated him for year but get too caught up in drinking to do it kenny seth green the wigger who ha decided that this party will be where he will finally get laid uh huh and denise the only exceptional character who unfortunately get stuck in a bathroom don t ask with kenny where the two character let down their character and are allowed to follow the law of plot cliche from point a to point b with nary a bit of characterization involved after awhile ugh the main comparison this film is getting to another film is actually not american grafitti or dazed and confused two film that embraced and ultimately made human out of many of it high schoolers not to mention were extremely entertaining but to john hughes film of the s most notably sixteen candle the big difference in the two is that that film managed to not only embrace but even satirize it main character and did so equally and in an entertaining fashion this film forgets to satirize it character and ultimately tell a story about a bunch of uninteresting stereotype and then say that it s all okay we can t take this film seriously nor can we take this a fun so really what good is it but i will tell you some thing i did like i liked the direction except for a couple too over the top feature like way too glossy jump cut it s like an oxymoron and other obscurity generally though elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement and even manage to capture an altman esque feel to their film from time to time a thing with a note though is too hokey to really be admirable i actually did like seth green for once in about a decade when he played a very young woody allen in radio day his desintegration of his wigger character wa almost believable almost and of course lauren ambrose is wonderful a denise the one character we could have used some more of even though it would have changed the entirety of the film however the character of denise really doesn t work with the film when really thought about she s far too witty and realized at least for the first half to belong in this film and whenever she appears she automatically give everything a delightfully satirical tone she s not just the cynic or the intellectual she s just a very interesting character who provides entertainment even if it further damage other already damaged character she may ruin the film more but at least when she s on screen we can sit up and think to ourselves well at least we ll be entertained a couple other thing that just don t work mike s character who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end act a though he ha forgotten everything too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general the aimless bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda give me a break and perhaps the one thing that just doesn t work at all jenna eflman s uncredited cameo a an angel just didn t work but nice try basically the worst thing about this film the real reason i m giving this such a low rating is because it refuse to give u any fully realized character and then insists we follow around complete stereotype from other movie doing thing that are inane and unlike anything we d do we don t feel for these character because for most of u we aren t stereotype going through the motion to worn subplots the acid test for high school movie is doe it at all capture the feel of what it s portraying the answer for this film is no nice try though\n",

where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actor stargate wa a financial success independence day wa a runaway hit and with godzilla already drowning in hype and merchandising tie in before it even open it s virtually guaranteed at least million nice number for a film that could have been penned by a not too precocious grade school kid godzilla isn t completely without merit although it is close there s a certain visceral thrill inherent in watching the giant lizard rip his way through manhattan but it wear off quickly frankly while the special effect are competent they re not all that stunning there s nothing new here it s jurassic park meet alien with a little independence day thrown in for bad measure maybe it will require george lucas and his new star war movie to take computer generated visuals to the next level godzilla never really push the envelope preferring to remain within a comfort zone the imagination of monster movie like king kong ha been replaced by a crass formulaic approach which disallows creativity how disturbing is it to know that godzilla ha been chosen to close the st cannes film festival worst of all godzilla isn t even exciting with the possible exception of a mildly enjoyable car chase near the end there isn t a sequence in this film that raise the pulse even the scene with dozen of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn provoking independence day may have been dumb but it wa full of adrenaline moment capable of getting the audience involved in the action in this aspect of it production a in so many others godzilla is lacking actually part of the problem is that we re never sure who we re supposed to be rooting for the green monster with an attitude or the paper thin human trying to stop him the plot such a it is can be summed up rather simply after sinking a few ship and leaving some footprint on tropical island godzilla show up in the big apple he doe some of the usual tourist thing stop by garden visit the chrysler building go on a walk through central park and take the subway in the process he knock over a few building and step on countless cab but he never ha trouble with traffic jam on hand to stop him is an elite u s army unit led by a slightly less arrogant than usual military man kevin dunn and a biologist named nick tatopoulos who ha a theory about godzilla in his opinion the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportion a a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb test in the south pacific in nick s word godzilla is a mutated aberration an incipient creature the first of it kind a luck would have it nick s old girlfriend audrey maria pitillo is a reporter based at a new york tv station along with her cameraman friend animal hank azaria she decides to follow nick around a he trail godzilla then just when the military ha rejected nick s theory about why godzilla is in new york a member of the french secret service jean reno recruit him for a special assignment instead of stomping around tokyo this time godzilla ha chosen new york city unfortunately manhattan ha been destroyed so many time in recent disaster movie independence day deep impact armageddon that it s becoming boring the whole tradition of monster roaming around the city started with king kong but the big ape wa only about foot tall he could climb the empire state building at ten time that height godzilla would be more likely to knock it over godzilla contains a few lame attempt at humor there s an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that play like sit com material an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick s last name properly and a rather tame attack on film critic roger ebert and gene siskel both of the popular personality have alter ego in the film ebert the mayor of new york is played by michael lerner and gene lorry goldman is his campaign manager ebert s re election slogan is not surprisingly thumb up for new york the siskel ebert stuff is amusing the first time it s used but after a while it grows tiresome and although the character don t serve any real purpose they keep popping up godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast this is largely because emmerich doesn t want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard that s not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren t capable of good performance both have done their share of solid acting in the past but they aren t a list name then again considering the quality of the writing even pacino and deniro would have been hard pressed to shine maria pitillo dear god play the love interest and hank azaria great expectation is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief ultimately it doesn t really matter what i or any other critic for that matter have to say about the movie tristar ha assumed that godzilla like all self proclaimed summer event motion picture is pretty much critic proof it may also be word of mouth proof those who want to see the movie will see it no matter what i write or their friend say so when i go on record to assert that godzilla is one of the most idiotic blockbuster movie of all time it s like spitting into the wind emmerich and devlin are master illusionist waving their wand and mesmerizing audience with their smoke and mirror it s probably too much to hope that some day movie goer will wake up and realize that they ve been had\n",

talented people involved with the film avika goldsman s screenplay is such a cluttered mess that there is no suspense built from one scene to another this coming on the heals of such a marvelously written project a the client is such a shock that it give rise to thought that the latter film wa a fluke situation are developed and executed with no thought of reason other that to get the character from one point to another this is most glaringly brought to point by the appearance of alicia silverstone s batgirl who just happens to be alfred s niece the story of dr victor freeze is told almost completely in dialogue a an afterthought while working on a cure for a tragic decease contracted by his wife dr freeze is injured during a cryogenic procedure and becomes a man who can only survive in a sub zero environment now of course he ha become a terrorist intent on turning the world into a frozen planet where only he can live now the logic of that little sub plot escape me if mr freeze wanted to find a cure for his wife and bring her back from the brink of death why would he want to have her live in a world with no warmth this is indeed a cold hearted man the development of poison ivy is no less contradictory she want to breed a form of plant life that can defend itself like an animal she join with mr freeze in his plan to start a new ice age destroying all animal life therefore giving her plant creation no reason to have the defense mechanism she had been trying to breed into them the character have no logic batman of course is no longer the dark knight of the earlier film now that he ha an adoptive son in burt ward robin bruce wayne is trying to be a father figure constantly spouting out homily about family and relationship while at the same time not really having any george clooney try in vain to keep from rolling his eye while reciting the dialogue given him to say that his performance is workman like is to be generous his best performance are

wa for nicole kidman s psychologist in batman forever between bruce and anyone other than alfred and even that relationship is very reserved robin come off less charismatic that in the last film in the series now he s just a spoiled kid in batman forever burt ward wanted to be batman s partner and friend now robin is suffering from ego deficiency robin s attraction for poison ivy is not believable except for a boy around the age of his later flirtation with batgirl smack of incest even though they are not related in a traditional sense chris o donnell once considered a rising star successfully burn up on reentry with this performance his robin need nothing more than a good spanking the less said about alicia silverstone s performance the better this talented young actress read her line with all the aplomb of a dubbing actor for a godzilla film she wa cast strictly for her commercial value and she knew it this brings u to the villain arnold scharzenegger walk through his part with all the concern of someone waiting for payday the most rediculous scene is during mr freeze s imprisonment the guard are at least a foot taller that arnold and yet fall at his hand in one of the most unbelievable fight scene caught on film it s almost a ludicrous a seeing michael jackson a a gang member umu thurman strut and coo her way through her part showing a growing discomfort with her sex symbol status her poison ivy ha all the come hither sex appeal of may west in sextette the only performance worthy of notice are pat hingle and michael gough these two seasoned veteran carry their scene with a dignity sorely lacking from the rest of the film without going through the intricacy of the plot there is one question that always come to mind with this series except for the first batman and that is how do these super villain manage to hire so many thug only to abandon them at the final reel mr freeze is introduced with a team of hockey playing hoodlum that seem to have stepped out of an old kiss music video every villain even the minor one have to have a look no one can be an individual with day glow paint on their face or some sort of elaborate costume with this film

associated with the old series you almost wonder if william dozier producer of the tv series is collecting royalty from this film the special effect by john dykstra and production design by barbara ling are the primary star of this film and it is a case of extravagance in the pursuit of nothing every set from ivy s lair the batcave to freeze s hideout is set with enough neon and fiberglass to keep the epa in paperwork for year to come there is no one realistic set or set piece in the film everything is set for maximum exposure the special effect have that strange cartoon look that most rushed cgi effect have there are homage thrown in by dykstra and his team to gene warren and his work on the time machine the growing plant scene but these scene are so wroth with glaring color and art that they are almost obscured joel schumacher ha directed the film with no flair camera angle are poorly chosen rehashing set ups from the old tv series master shot pepper the action scene destroying any flow of kinetic quality they may have had mr schumacher is a good director one just ha to look back on the film the lost boy cousin an underrated film and the client to know that but batman and robin come off a a mated made for tv movie the film ha no style of individuality it is the cinematic equivalent to jell o pretty to look at but empty it is unfortunate that this film even with it s surprisingly strong box office ha succeeded in doing what warner s thought tim burton would do with the franchise kill it joel schumacher s batman robin is loud colorful action packed and ultimately boring star\n",

scott charles hendricks barry snider romero julia barr norma child mpaa rating r review in the updating of mickey spillane s novel i the jury hard boiled detective mike hammer is a vietnam vet who drive a shiny bronze trans am dress like don johnson in miami vice with less pastel and ha sworn off alcohol however he still smoke his lucky strike detests all form of authority and kill at a whim beyond that the updated film retains little or no resemblance to the original pulpy page turner by spillane probably the most infamous and often reviled of all mystery writer the movie start off with a bang a howler of an opening credit sequence that is a cheap steal from the james bond series complete with cheesy graphic and an overbearing jazz score by bill conti rocky after that the movie and the book begin the same with the murder of jack williams frederick down a one armed detective and hammer s best friend hammer declares that he will seek vengeance for jack s death and with the help of his devoted secretary the blond and shapely velda laurene landon and the alternately friendly antagonistic police chief pat chamber paul sorvino he is immediately on the killer s trail here the movie split completely from the book and dive into a convoluted and improbable tale of government conspiracy and mind control tactic involving the mafia the cia one of hammer s vietnam vet buddy and a kinky sex clinic many of the same character from the book appear in the movie but they take on slightly different role for instance charles kalecki alan king a number runner and narcotic dealer in the book turn into a suave mob bos and more importantly hammer s suspicious love interest charlotte bennett barbara carrera morphs from a run of the mill psychiatrist into the coordinator and founder of the sex clinic i the jury is one of several cinematic rendition of spillane s book including a version which wa made in d but this film differs from those earlier version in one major way it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood s production code although this take the version of i the jury closer to the core of the original subject matter it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism because it took this new license to extreme that many argued surpassed what wa in the book rest assured the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity but it is thoroughly violent especially toward woman it feature one woman having her neck slashed a set of twin forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia judson scott and another woman shot point blank in the belly by hammer himself no one would deny that spillane s writing ha a definite misogynistic nature but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment it constant equation of sex and violence much of which is played with the intention of being erotic is quite unsettling it s no surprise that the movie like the book fade to black with a dead woman on the floor i the jury had a troubled production and wa not well supported by the studio that made it which is one explanation why it didn t do well in theater and many people have forgotten that it wa ever made the script wa written by larry cohen who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movie like it s alive and it two sequel q and the stuff cohen wrote the script thinking he wa going to helm the project a well but he wa yanked from the director s chair after only a week s worth of shooting because he wa already over budget he wa quickly replaced by richard t heffron who ha worked for the last three decade on a handful of undistinguished movie and dozen of television project heffron wa obviously brought in not for his talent but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently it show in the final product cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer but heffron ha none he shot the movie quickly and clumsily and although some scene ring true most of them are flat trite and invariably dull the movie feature numerous car chase shoot out and stunt but heffron s background in television is the dominant tone despite the graphic violence and full frontal nudity i the jury take on the air of a made for tv quickie with no real punch or depth but the problem in i the jury run deeper than the technical the central fault in this updating is mike hammer whose character wa lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifty to the eighty because spillane wrote all his hammer mystery in the first person hammer s character is central to the tale because all the event are filtered through his persona we never really get that impression in the movie there is no first person voice over narration and some scene don t have hammer in them at all consequently a great deal of the texture of spillane s storytelling is lost the period updating turn out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer s moral code is thrown to the wind despite his characterization a a hard nosed violent misogynistic killer hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code the title itself i the jury refers to his anti establishment notion of being his own law unlike private eye who seek out the bad guy and then turn them over the police hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment in this way he can be seen a above the law but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct his own morality the movie forgoes that aspect of his character and hammer come off not only a amoral in society s term but in any term especially his own if anything hammer always had his professionalism but the movie doe away with that in the first three minute by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife wa being unfaithful maybe the scene wa intended for laugh but it only cheapens hammer s character and is by all account a lousy way to start the movie the blame for hammer s character can t be laid on assante s shoulder because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon like mumbling he delivers a fine performance spillane never once described hammer s physical attribute in any of the dozen book in which he appeared so any actor could conceivably portray him of course because of the lack of written description those who have read spillane s book will have a strong personal notion of what hammer look like and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectation spillane who played the character himself in s the girl hunter is generally considered the best of the film hammer the rest of actor are most un noteworthy with the exception of alan king and paul sorvino everyone who appeared in i the jury were up and comer who basically went nowhere many of them ended up working in television like carrera who had a short stint on dallas in the mid eighty which only add to the made for tv atmosphere of the film maybe someday someone will manage to get the right element together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book but this is certainly not it\n",

miserably fails to be serious that it s oddly fascinating the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaf the audience somehow transfixed wanting to see how this dud play out the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m auel to this day the book possesses a loyal cult following i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog eared copy of the novel she had read a a child with all the so called dirty part blacked out with marker by her grandmother i have never read this book but i sure hope it s time better than it film adaptation if not then i m at a complete loss to explain it popularity the clan of the cave bear immediately open with a comically absurd scene a young ayla looking much like drew barrymore in e t tramp about in the wood with her cute little ponytail and fur

of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wig she s of the new people they re of the old people with the memory yep we get it we get it the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make up which surprise me the movie depends upon a lot of make up obviously but much of it is unconvincing a stated before daryl hannah is daryl hannah here she look like she just stepped out of the shower all the time the rest of the character have dark make up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt the face painting that s occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind this movie also suffers from it new age trapping maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during but now it sound dated and cliched like poorly conceived elevator music add to this the film s faux mysticism including spirit animal and dream vision and a narrator who sound like a psychic you d expect to hear on a number and you get a movie that ha serious problem being serious the clan of the cave bear is rated r though it s probably one of the most inoffensive offensive film i ve seen in quite a while it contains several scene of sex sans nudity the violence mostly consists of hunting scene the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempt to rescue her from a ferocious bear the bear bite his head off and the audience see it rolling about although this may sound gratuitous i m sure it s so cheesy that it probably won t bother most people the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie however a i wrote at the beginning of this review it doe have the distinction of originality typically when i think of bottom of the barrel film dealing with early man fantasy movie involving dinosaur who did not exist at the same time a man and raquel welch come to mind the clan of the cave bear try so hard to be serious that though it s so bad the audience is still interested by the unique setting and character of the movie which is why i awarded this turkey two star i have to think that fan of the book would be disappointed with this film version however i m only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie i shudder to think that it could be otherwise\n",

      "Sentence: if anything stigma should be taken a a warning against releasing similarly themed film relatively close to one another of the four supernatural horror flick released this year it is clearly the worst i suppose i should have seen this coming after all blair witch thoroughly creeped me out sixth sense wa mildly spooky and then stir of echo had it moment but wasn t anything i d lose sleep over clearly the quality of the horror this summer ha slowly been dropping is it then any surprise that stigma is the dullest most horribly executed piece of mtv influenced tripe i have seen in a long while no not really patricia arquette play frankie page a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary a a gift from her globe trotting mother a it turn out the rosary belonged to a recently deceased brazilian priest the priest s church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan gabriel byrne because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue father kiernan is an investigator who ha made a career out of disproving supposed religious sign but this time he belief there is something to the bleeding statue his investigation is soon called off however when the frankie start exhibiting sign of the stigma in which a person is inflicted with wound like that of jesus christ father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie s story considering she s an atheist but once he witness the stigma attack himself he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on he eventually begin to suspect that his bos cardinal houseman jonathan pryce is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church a it turn out the dead priest had been working on the translation of a fifth gospel before they were excommunicated the new rupert wainwright music video i mean film stigma is the sort of film that start off ok and only get worse indeed it would have been good if it were a music video because it s only interesting for about five minute i m not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow motion double exposure and extreme close ups whoaaaaaa other than the fact that he ha the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and yes he ha been to film school his camera trickery is interesting for a little while but eventually it becomes headache inducing what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue such a it is with wainwright screaming at the audience see look at what i can do i m an ex cellent dir ect or maybe then he d explain why he decided to start half of his scene with slow motion shot of water dripping in reverse or why he included random superfluous shot a that of an egg frying ooh scary if there wa some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery i didn t see it just when you thought it wa safe to get involved in the story here come a double exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever arrrrrrrghhhh then again the superfluous camera trickery wouldn t bother me if stigma had a story or character that were remotely engaging though wainwright s vanity certainly doesn t help he doe seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script where are plot continuity and character development when you need them case in point frankie page is the character that i assume we are supposed to identify and sympathize with but we aren t given any back story on her character or any reason to like her the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard working hairdresser who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building and she s kind of cute so let s start the bleeding the fact that she s clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn t help either according to frankie page what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wound on your wrist and back go clubbing sure that make sense arquette byrne and pryce give it the old college try but their character are so one dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking scene between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reach the point of becoming laughable even though frankie page s life is falling apart before her very eye she still find the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon even more curiously he seems to be interested in her advance father andrew s religious doubt pop up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic a for pryce he may a well wear a curled mustache and cackle i ll get you my pretty for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded trust me i m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turn out to be a villain what s worse after being faced with dull character and the prospect of having annoying camera trick and loud music jammed down our throat we now have to contend with a story that start off in one direction veers off in another then another and end up being totally incomprehensible first of all the film doesn t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot detail how doe frankie get the stigma merely by touching a rosary how come an atheist like her wa chosen since father andrew mention that only very devout believer have ever received stigma actually i m not sure what frankie wa posessed by supposedly stigma occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit but the film later ha her being posessed by the dead priest and later by some evil spirit i think which one is it the answer to this question of course is very simple the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effect and flashy camera work mr wainwright want to use this time furthermore the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap up and the filmmaker compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church if you do any research at all about the gospel of st thomas you ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church a the film seems to claim but that it is readily available at your local library there s nothing the catholic need to worry about though stigma s religion is so off base that it can t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church if they wanted to portray catholic priest a mobster they should have gone all out and equipped them with sharkskin suit and tommy gun which would have been far more interesting i m not catholic in fact i don t care much for the catholic church but it cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any mean it s rare to see a film that fails on a many level a stigma doe it s not thought provoking though it would like to be and it is definitely not scary though it pretend to be i m not sure why they tried to pas this off a a horror film because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story maybe it s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scene have any dramatic weight whatsoever the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over and over and over like so many film of the mtv generation this one suffers from overkill so much is overdone in stigma that it eventually ha no effect on the audience leaving u to pick out the film s many flaw i m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st thomas is so earth shattering when we finally hear it the saying sound like something every five year old learns on their first day of sunday school which mean that for all it flash the whole film is really much ado about nothing the dog day of summer usually produce one monstrous dog and stigma is it\n",

      "Sentence: john boorman s zardoz is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it take on a bizarre enjoyment quality all it own not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d wood jr ha a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time of course wood s career can be explained by two thing he had no money and he had no talent boorman on the other hand can not court such excuse to explain zardoz or his follow up film the equally awful exorcist ii the heretic boorman obviously had a sizable budget a matinee idol movie star sean connery in the lead role and although you wouldn t know it from this film boorman doe indeed have talent this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece deliverance a well a the autobiographical world war ii drama hope and glory the slightly over conceived arthurian epic excalibur and the father son jungle adventure the emerald forest his film all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination but sometimes that come at the cost of coherence and taste if boorman is anything he s ambitious and when he succeeds it s in grand fashion unfortunately the bigger they are the harder they fall and when boorman fall the resounding impact can be heard for mile around zardoz is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystical movie an obsession of boorman s his screenplay try to elicit the same mythological connotation of the arthurian legend or even the wizard of oz a book which figure into the movie s plot but despite all this reaching the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling the event take place in the distant year but there is little of the typical futuristic movie ness to be found in fact thing seems to have moved backwards with people riding horse shooting old style gun and living in large victorian mansion it s more middle age than space age the world of zardoz is divided into two distinct hemisphere the outlands where all the poor pathetic people live and the vortex where a select group of wealthy intellectual live in comfort and everlasting life these immortal never grow old they never engage in sexual activity they possess psychological power and they live in a sort of quasi utopian marxist society where everyone is equal and everyone contributes equally to the society however if one break the rule that person is punished by being aged so many year if someone break the rule enough he or she is aged to the point of senility and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminal one of the immortal arthur frayn niall buggy a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the resident to farm so the immortal can be fed like the wizard of oz he adopts a god like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head this flying head is one of the movie s opening image and it s a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come calling himself zardoz frayn gather a bunch of outlander and make them into a group called the exterminator whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlander so they can t procreate and take up more resource from inside his giant stone head zardoz bellow seriously laugh inducting statement like the gun is good the penis is evil that line alone is worth the movie s cult following one day an exterminator named zed sean connery sneak into zardoz s flying stone push frayn out and go back to the vortex once there the immortal label him a brutal and study him like a lab rat taking great perverse care in exploring his sexuality which is a mystery to them they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily clad female scientist show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what get him worked up i say hilarious because that is exactly what zardoz is it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so he made this film with the straightest of face although i have a hard time believing that a production moved forward he didn t get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it wa becoming just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggle he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper a mane of hair braided halfway down his back a wyatt earp style handlebar mustache and a pair of thigh high patent leather boot that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of deliverance which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green light this effort he attracted some rich talent on both side of the camera including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in zardoz besides the inadvertent humor sean connery had made his last james bond film in and perhaps he wa looking for a change in pace he got exactly that in zardoz and it s a wonder it didn t end his career i m sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statement is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing or is it a social statement something about the inherent negativity of class distinction and the violence it creates karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary come to think of it maybe boorman made it a an extended lsd trip people high on illicit substance are the only one i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness a anything more than a completely unintentional comedy\n",
